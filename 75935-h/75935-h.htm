FOREWORD
</p>

<p>
One day, a little more than a hundred years
ago, a boy was walking along a crowded
street in London.  It is likely that Dick
Whittington had walked on the very same street
about the time when he heard Bow Bells ring.
But this boy was not thinking about the bells of
London.  He had been reading a story in a book,
and he was thinking of the people in the story,
especially of a man called Leander who swam
across the straits named the Hellespont.
</p>

<p>
The story of Hero and Leander is told in a
poem.  These two people were in love with one
another.  But Hero, who was very beautiful, was
a priestess of Aphrodite, and she was not supposed
to fall in love or marry.  Leander lived at
Abydos, which is on one side of the straits of the
Hellespont.  Hero lived in a high tower at Sestos,
which is on the other side of the straits.  The
shores are rocky and dangerous, beautiful to look
at, but hazardous for sailors and ships.  Tides and
winds make it difficult to sail through the straits,
and very difficult at times to swim across from
shore to shore.  Leander used to swim from
Abydos to Sestos after nightfall to see Hero, who
had become his wife; and Hero, on her high tower,
held a lighted lamp that shone like a star to guide
Leander so that he would not be dashed on the
rocks.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="Pvi"></a>vi}</span>
</p>

<p>
The name of the boy who had been reading the
story was Samuel Taylor Coleridge.  He was a
country boy, the son of a clergyman, and he was
at a boarding school in London.  The school was
for boys whose parents had not much money or
who had no parents living.
</p>

<p>
On a school holiday, after breakfast, at which
there was not a great deal to eat, the boys who
were boarders were sent out into London and
were not expected to come back until nightfall.
Sometimes, they had nothing to eat all day long
until supper-time.  Coleridge was one of the boys
who had to spend his holidays in this fashion.
</p>

<p>
On one holiday, Coleridge, as he walked along
the crowded street, began to imagine how it would
feel if he were swimming the Hellespont with
Leander.  You know how often we think when we
are reading an interesting book that we are living
with the people in the story.  Being greatly
absorbed in his thoughts, Coleridge began to move
his arms as if he were swimming.  If he had been
in a field by himself, or on an empty street, no one
would have minded.  But Coleridge was on a
crowded street, and by and by one of his arms
struck a man who was passing, and his hand
caught in the man's pocket.  The man thought
that Coleridge, who was only a boy, was trying
to steal from him.  However, he asked Coleridge a
good many questions, and discovered that the boy
had been reading in a book the story of Hero and
Leander, and had been imagining that he was
swimming across the Hellespont.
</p>

<p>
When the man found that Coleridge loved reading,
but could not get the books he wanted easily,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="Pvii"></a>vii}</span>
he took the boy to a library, which was not a free
library but one where people had to pay a fee, and
the man arranged for Coleridge to be allowed to
read there.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Many stories are told of the different ways in
which boys and girls have found famous books
which they have read with enjoyment, and never
forgotten.  Another boy called Samuel&mdash;Samuel
Johnson&mdash;had been looking for apples that he
knew were hidden somewhere.  He climbed upon a
step-ladder to look behind the rows of books in his
father's book shop, and while he was looking for
the apples he found Plutarch's <i>Lives</i>.  Very likely
the boy Samuel Johnson began reading the book,
and forgot about the apples.  Another boy once
was told to watch a fire, which was burning rubbish
in a field, so that it would not spread and burn
the fences.  He watched the fire for a while, but
he had a book in his pocket and presently he
forgot to watch, and so the fence was burned.  Likely
he was punished at the time, but years after his
friends used to tell the story, for the boy had
become an eminent man.  How many of us have
climbed into trees to read books in a leafy
solitude!  Louisa May Alcott was one of the girls,
later known for her charming stories, who had a
special tree into which she used to climb, so that no
one should interrupt her while she was reading.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
This book which you are reading now is meant
to help you to find books that you will enjoy.  You
may begin at the first chapter; perhaps this is the
best way.  Or you may look at the list of chapters,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="Pviii"></a>viii}</span>
and try the one which seems to you most
interesting.  But when you have read that chapter,
come back to the beginning and start over again.
</p>

<p>
Fairy tales and stories of marvels you will find
described in Part III, also stories of heroes, and
such stories as <i>Alice in Wonderland</i>, Kipling's
stories, and Malory's <i>Morte d'Arthur</i>, a great
book telling of knights and their adventures.
</p>

<p>
The books in Part I are wonderfully interesting.
In this Part you will find examples of some
of the ways in which we may enjoy books of
famous authors, for instance, the work of novelists
like Dickens and Scott, and the plays of a great
dramatist like Shakespeare.  First, we may read
some of their stories or plays; then we may learn
of the lives of these authors, especially about that
part of their lives when they were young which
is always interesting; and finally, we can read of
the world as it was when these writers lived in
it and of the effect their work has had on this
world of ours.
</p>

<p>
Part II is about romance and adventure.  In
Part IV you will find ballads and stories in rhyme
or verse.  Part V tells of some of the greatest
writers and their work.  Part VI is meant to
help boys and girls to be good citizens, and to
undertake all kinds of responsibilities when they are
men and women.  In one of the chapters of Part
VI there is a list of books, many of which are
biographies of noted men and women, but there are
also books about such subjects as flying, inventions,
science, hobbies, birds, flowers, gardens and
mountain climbing.  The last chapter in Part VI
tells of some books of travel and discovery.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="Pix"></a>ix}</span>
</p>

<p>
The books in Part VII are specially enjoyable,
because they are intimate books; and you will find
great poetry spoken of in Part VIII.
</p>

<p>
We do not all like the same books; and this is
likely the best way, for some books which may
seem dull to us, other people find interesting.
What is important is for each of us to discover
the books we enjoy most.
</p>

<p>
So if we do not happen to like <i>Gulliver's
Travels</i> by Jonathan Swift, there is no great harm
done, although Dean Swift was a notable writer.
And if some of you do not care for Robert Louis
Stevenson's <i>Child's Garden of Verse</i> now, the
chances are that by the time you are over sixty,
you will think it a charming book, and you may
even repeat the verses aloud to your grand-children.
</p>

<p>
We never know when we may discover, hidden
in the midst of dullness perhaps, some gem of a
story or poem; and this is one of the reasons
why most of us love reading, and will take a good
deal of trouble to find the books we enjoy.
</p>

<p>
Before you read this book, perhaps you had
better ask yourselves the question, what kind of
books each one of you cares for most?  And then,
after that, ask yourselves another question, what
kinds of books do you think you would like to
enjoy?  The last question is worth considering with
not a little care; for when we think about it, we
really set out on a journey into the world of books.

CHAPTER I
<br><br>
SOME OF DICKENS' NOVELS AND CHARACTERS
</h3>

<p>
It is an odd reflection how silent a book may
seem when it is waiting on a shelf to be read.
But once its covers are opened, and our eyes
follow the lines of print for page after page,
voices speak, people that we had not known
before become familiar to us or old friends give us
greeting; thoughts, knowledge, events, pass from
the silent pages into our minds.  Some books
possess this property of rich and glowing life in a
high degree.  No books surely have it more
abundantly than the novels of Charles Dickens.
</p>

<p>
Here are scores of friends for us, playmates,
companions.  If anyone has a fit of loneliness, or
should anyone be looking for change and variety,
let him open one of Dickens' novels.  Which one
will he choose first?  A boy or girl is well
advised who takes, shall we say, <i>David Copperfield</i>
or <i>Pickwick Papers</i>.  One or the other will make
an excellent beginning.  Having read one, or
both, it is unlikely that the reader will refrain
from adding five, six, seven, eight, or even twelve
more novels by Dickens to the list of books he is
happy to remember having read.
</p>

<p>
What are the names of Dickens' other better

should lose the benefit of having read <i>A
Christmas Carol</i>.  And there is also the unfinished
novel <i>Edwin Drood</i>, probably more talked of still
than any other story of a mystery, new or old.  It
is nearly sixty years since Dickens left the story
incomplete, but how gladly many people still
would discover the secret ending that the great
novelist had planned in his mind.
</p>

<p>
Once read, Dickens' novels cling to the memory.
The characters he made inhabit this world
of ours as substantially, it seems, as people do
who have been born not from imagination merely.
As lately as the spring of 1928 a London hotel,
the Adelphi, changed owners.  In a brief history
of the place a list of persons was given who had
visited it, ending with the remark that Mr. Pickwick
had had his first dinner there after being
released from prison.  The other people mentioned
were what we describe as historical characters.
Mr. Pickwick, although thousands of people know
him so well that if they met him on the street they
could not possibly fail to recognize him, is the
miraculous product of Dickens' imagination.  If
you have not read <i>Pickwick Papers</i>, in a few hours
you too may know Mr. Pickwick, and he will be
for you also a lifetime friend.
</p>

<p>
When we read these stories for the first time,
we must be prepared to become acquainted with
Dickens' characters much in the same way as we
meet strangers in everyday life.  His people are
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P5"></a>5}</span>
odd, exuberant, amusing, extravagant; they are
too strange to be true, we may say to ourselves.
But as we read on, we come to know them so well
that the oddness and queerness seem to wear off.
We look into their hearts and forget to be
surprised by their extraordinary looks and
characteristics.  Sam Weller is odd, but he is the most
delightful, amusing young man on his own, once
boots at the White Hart Inn.  Like Mr. Pickwick,
Sam lives in <i>Pickwick Papers</i>.  No one could
imagine a better Sam Weller than Dickens'
creation, for the simple reason that to make a better
Sam Weller is impossible.
</p>

<p>
It is a great, a glorious adventure to sit out of
doors in summer, or in a warm, quiet room in
winter, and read one of Dickens' novels.  What
happenings, what delightful, absorbing people,
what a stir of life, what laughter, gaiety, bravery,
what wonderful meetings with high and low
fortune!
</p>

<p>
The world of Dickens' novels is a world of
coaching days, of old English roads and inns, of
feasts and conviviality; a sporting world, often
hard and cruel, in which existed bad old customs
against which Dickens fought with all his might;
a boisterous world of strange adventures, great
friendships, and measureless laughter.  These
books are crowded with people, diverting and
friendly, grotesque and menacing, or grotesque
outside but with golden hearts hidden behind the
queer exteriors, loving people, heartless people,
beautiful people, brave, true friends, friends of
everybody.
</p>

<p>
We have already spoken of Mr. Pickwick and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P6"></a>6}</span>
Sam Weller, his man or valet.  Mr. Pickwick's
benevolence, his goodness of heart, innocence and
simplicity make us love him more and more as the
story unfolds.  Sam's wit and audacity, his
extraordinary good humour and high spirits, his
devotion to Mr. Pickwick, his independence and
self-reliance, make Sam so real that he seems never
far away.  He is always only round the corner of
our minds and will appear jauntily as soon as we
think of him.  In the one book, <i>Pickwick Papers</i>,
there are a dozen other characters only less
wonderful than these two.  Would anyone prove at
once how diverting and delightful such a book can
be, let him read of Christmas at Dingley Dell in
chapter 28, or the Adventure at the Great White
Horse Inn, chapter 22, or the trial of Bardell
against Pickwick, chapter 34, or for natural
feeling simply expressed the lines in which Tony
Weller, Sam's father, tells of Mrs. Weller's death
in chapter 52, or the downfall of Mr. Stiggins, in
the same chapter, or, in the last chapter of all, of
Sam's devotion to Mr. Pickwick.
</p>

<p>
Striking characters of a like description are to
be found in all Dickens' novels.  <i>David Copperfield</i>
is probably the richest of all, in this respect,
although one can easily imagine a dispute
amongst the warm admirers of Dickens as to
which novel is pre-eminent in the possession of
immortal characters.  Those who love <i>David
Copperfield</i> best can scarcely discuss the book
with detachment; it belongs, as it were, to such a
reader's own special family life.  The novel holds
a wonderful company of people: David himself,
Peggotty, her brother and nephew, Little Em'ly,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P7"></a>7}</span>
Mrs. Gummidge, Miss Betsey Trotwood, Steerforth,
Traddles, the magnificent Wilkins Micawber
and Mrs. Micawber, Uriah Heep, Miss
Mowcher, Mr. Spenlow, Dora, and many, many
others.  <i>David Copperfield</i> was Dickens' own
favourite among his books.
</p>

<p>
In <i>Nicholas Nickleby</i> is the infamous school,
Dotheboys Hall, and Wackford Squeers, the
schoolmaster.  Dickens' crusades for reform will
be considered in another chapter.  But Mrs. Nickleby
is one of the most memorable of Dickens'
foolish characters.  Surely no other writer has
achieved so many delineations of the silly person,
masterpieces touched with an unerring hand.  Yet,
and this point is perhaps the crown of Dickens'
genius, these foolish characters of his often
reveal, before the novels to which they belong are
ended, some nobility of character, some goodness
of heart, some greatness in conduct or of nature
which makes us bow before them as belonging to
the highest ranks of human nature.  Toots in
<i>Dombey and Son</i> is a very foolish person, but
Toots saying goodbye to Florence Dombey shows
a chivalry comparable with that of Sir Philip
Sidney.
</p>

<p>
Dick Swiveller and the Marchioness belong to
<i>The Old Curiosity Shop</i>.  Barnaby Rudge and his
raven Grip are easily found.  Mr. Pecksniff,
Sairey Gamp and Betsey Prig, terrible examples
of hypocrisy and heartlessness, are from <i>Martin
Chuzslewit</i>.  But the same book has loveable Tom
Pinch and indomitable Mark Tapley, the champion
of courage and good cheer in adversity.  Tiny
Tim and Bob Cratchit live forever in <i>A Christmas
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P8"></a>8}</span>
Carol</i>.  Paul and Florence, Captain Cuttle,
Susan Nipper, Mr. Toots, Cousin Feenix, belong
to the crowded pages of <i>Dombey and Son</i>.  <i>Bleak
House</i> is a wonderful story; if one chooses Caddy
Jellyby from its pages it is not because a dozen
other characters are not as interesting.  In <i>Great
Expectations</i> the boyhood of Pip is marvellously
portrayed.  Anyone who has read <i>Our Mutual
Friend</i> can never forget Mr. and Mrs. Boffin, or
Lizzie Hexam, or the R. Wilfer family, or Silas
Wegg, or Mr. Venus, or the dolls' dressmaker,
Jenny Wren, or Johnny the orphan, and
Mrs. Betty Higden and Sloppy.
</p>

<p>
It is a point not to be overlooked that Dickens
takes his characters from any occupation, but
preferably, it would seem, from the humblest.
Goodness of heart, wit, humour, gaiety, stout-heartedness,
are proved by him to exist in the most
depressing circumstances.  His heroes and heroines
do not wear crowns or jewels.  They are not
specially learned, and they are rarely wealthy or
beautiful, but they are good company, light-hearted,
and kind-hearted.  Love, faithfulness,
self-sacrifice, purity, sincerity, courage and
cheerfulness shine out from his pages so brightly and
so engagingly that we cannot but long to join the
company of those who travel the same road.

<h3>
CHAPTER II
<br><br>
CHARLES DICKENS&mdash;BOY AND MAN
</h3>

<p>
The best way to understand Charles Dickens
is to learn to know him first when he
was a boy.  Odd though it may sound, we
can actually become acquainted with the boy
Charles Dickens.  David Copperfield, at least in the
beginning of his story, is a close delineation of
the writer's own boyhood.  David's feelings, and
many of the happenings of his youth, are the
feelings and the happenings which made Charles
Dickens the boy and the man that he was.
</p>

<p>
While this is true, it is true at the same time
that we should use caution lest we read into a
story more than the author intends us to find
either about himself or of other people.  Human
beings are so wonderfully and strangely made
that no mortal, no matter how hard he tries, can
ever draw a perfectly true or a perfectly just
picture of anyone.  Some quality always escapes
analysis, and each person living now, or who ever
has lived, remains himself only.  Dickens drew a
wonderful picture of himself in David Copperfield.
This is one reason why we love David and
understand him so well.  Yet David Copperfield
is not exactly Charles Dickens.  We can scarcely
believe for one thing that David ever could have
written as well about Charles as Charles has
written about David.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P10"></a>10}</span>
</p>

<p>
When Dickens was a boy of ten he was sent to
work in a blacking warehouse by his father who
was at that time in a debtors' prison.  People,
when Dickens was a boy, were sometimes left in
prison for a long time if they could not pay their
debts.  Years afterwards, Dickens wrote of the
secret agony of his soul while he worked at
covering blacking bottles and of how he longed for
companions, boys of his own age.  Indeed, so
unhappy were his recollections that when he was
grown-up he mentioned these years to one person
only, John Forster, the friend who wrote his
biography; to remember this part of his life always
gave him great pain.
</p>

<p>
Charles Dickens was born at Portsmouth,
Hampshire, England, February 7th, 1812.  Life
in the Dickens family was not settled or stable.
They moved frequently, and were always more or
less uncertain as to the future.  The father, as
has been said, at one time was in a debtors'
prison, and the family, including Charles, became
familiar with the strange life of The Marshalsea
which is described with exactitude in more than
one of Dickens' novels, but especially in <i>Little
Dorrit</i>.  At other times, and even in the Marshalsea,
life for the Dickens family was interesting,
even exciting.  Charles was unhappy because of
the work to which he was put, and because he saw
clearly, although he was only a little fellow, that
he was losing the chance of obtaining an education.
He was, however, an extraordinarily observant
lad and read with passionate absorption
all the books that he could find.  Pictures of the
strange people he met and of the queer things they
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P11"></a>11}</span>
did remained with him throughout his life, and
from this material gathered in his youth he
fashioned his great novels.
</p>

<p>
He had dreams of what he would be and of what
he would do.  The family lived for a number of
years in Chatham, his father being a clerk in the
navy pay-office at the dockyard, and he used to
see, when he was walking with his father in the
neighbouring country, a house called Gadshill
Place.  He planned then that some day he would
own that house.  It was in 1856 that he became
the owner of Gadshill when he was forty-four
years old, a considerable achievement for the boy
of ten who had washed and re-covered blacking
bottles.  But many greater achievements than
this were brought about by the genius of Charles
Dickens.
</p>

<p>
All his life these youthful days were lived over
again in his stories and in his own memory.  To
a not inconsiderable extent they influence us, too,
because of the novels which Dickens wrote.  The
roads of Kent, where he went walking when they
lived in Chatham, are the great roads of his
novels.  The characters he wrote about were created
from traits and habits which he had observed in
people known by the boy Charles Dickens.  The
unjust laws and cruel customs against which he
fought so powerful a battle were those whose
victims had excited his pity long before he had grown
up.
</p>

<p>
When the family fortunes were brighter, Charles
Dickens went to school again for a couple of
years.  But from the time he was fifteen, he
earned his own living.  He began as a clerk or
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P12"></a>12}</span>
office boy.  Later, he studied shorthand, and
entered the reporters' gallery of the House of
Commons when he was nineteen.  He began to write
articles and sketches soon afterwards.  His first
book, <i>Sketches by Boz</i>, was published when he was
twenty-four.  In the same year, he married
Catherine Hogarth, the eldest daughter of George
Hogarth, a fellow writer on <i>The Morning Chronicle</i>,
who had been kind to him.
</p>

<p>
From this year, 1836, until his death in 1870,
he wrote a series of novels and stories with
extraordinary speed and diligence.  He travelled
much, but never ceased writing.  He gave many
public readings from his own works.  He visited
the United States and Canada in 1842, and in
1867-68 gave readings in the eastern cities of the
United States.  Wherever he went he was
received with acclaim, and he was at all times an
object of public attention.  His gifts were great, but
no one who follows the story of his life can help
being struck by his extraordinary capacity for
hard work.  All his life he laboured more
assiduously than any ordinary person can work; and
when he stopped writing, with one of his novels
unfinished, he was, as far as we can tell, still in
the enjoyment of almost undiminished powers as
a writer.
</p>

<p>
Dickens had been a sickly boy, often ill and
suffering.  As soon as he could be put to stand on
a chair, so young was he, he had given childish
recitations and sung childish songs for the
entertainment of his father's and mother's friends.  He
was, in effect, as a child somewhat spoiled by too
much attention.  Throughout his mature life he
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P13"></a>13}</span>
lived at white heat; ordinary quiet days had no
attraction for him.  He was inclined to think that
people treated him unjustly.  In truth, one is
reluctantly compelled to admit that Dickens was
over-sensitive and somewhat quarrelsome.  These
are, perhaps, the only faults, certainly the main
faults, in his character.  It can be said with
justice, however, that he was continually under strain
and pressure from overwork; he was, as well,
excitable by temperament.
</p>

<p>
One of the best brief descriptions of Dickens'
appearance is by Leigh Hunt.  "What a face is
his to meet in a drawing room!  It has the life
and soul in it of fifty human beings."  He lived
with an intensity which it is scarcely possible for
less intense people to understand.  He gave his
wonderful vitality without stint to the writing of
his books.  When he finished <i>David Copperfield</i>
his life had been so absorbed in its characters that
he wrote "I seem to be sending some part of myself
into the Shadowy World."  Thackeray said of
<i>A Christmas Carol</i>, "It seems to me a national
benefit..."  Dickens was generous in his praise
of the work of other writers, and deeply grateful
for any kindness shown himself, no matter how
slight the benefit was.  He quarrelled, one may
say, with America as well as with some of his
friends and contemporaries, but years afterwards
he wrote in a postscript to a later edition of
<i>Martin Chuzzlewit</i> a warm tribute to the magnanimity
of the country.  His married life was not
altogether happy.  But in Forster's <i>Life</i>, there is a
story that his daughters Mary and Kate having
taken pains to teach him the steps of the polka so
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P14"></a>14}</span>
that he might dance it at their brother's birthday
party, Dickens, waking in the middle of the night
before the party, was afraid that he had forgotten
the proper steps, and immediately got up out
of bed to practise them.
</p>

<p>
Two of his characters, Wilkins Micawber and
Mr. Dorritt, are drawn, to some extent at least,
from the character of his father; Mrs. Nickleby is
said to be a portrait of his mother.  It can at
least be conceded that Mr. Micawber and
Mrs. Nickleby are among the greatest characters ever
created by Dickens.  Apparently he had no unkind
intention; still, one would rather that he had
denied himself the use of this material.  He was
attached to his father and mother and took pleasure
in providing for their older years.  He bought
them a house a mile from the town of Exeter and
looked after the furnishing of the house himself.
</p>

<p>
His feeling for his children was deeply rooted
in his heart.  It expressed itself in numberless
ways, never more plainly than in a letter to his
youngest son written on the eve of the boy's leaving
to join his brother in Australia.  (Forster's
<i>Life of Charles Dickens</i>, Book xi, Part iii).
</p>

<p>
Dickens' popularity can hardly be over-estimated.
There is a story that while <i>Dombey and Son</i>
was being published in monthly parts, a man who
kept a snuff shop in London and had as well a
number of lodgers, read aloud the month's instalment
on the first Monday of every month at a tea.
Only those who paid for the tea shared in it, but all
the lodgers could listen to the story.  The incident
affords a striking picture of the power Dickens
had over all kinds of people.  Recent reminiscences
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P15"></a>15}</span>
by one of Dickens' sons tell of how when
he was walking once with his father along the
broad walk at the Zoo in London, they met a little
girl running ahead of her father and mother;
when she saw who it was she ran back crying,
"Oh, mummy! mummy! it is Charles Dickens."  Dickens
was greatly pleased.
</p>

<p>
He made for everyone who lived with him a life
of constant gaiety and variety.  Well-known and
celebrated people shared this entertainment.  His
heart was passionately attached to the cause of
the poor and oppressed.  He had unfailing belief
in human nature, and was hopeful of everyone
and everything.  A well-known statesman who
lived in Queen Victoria's youth once said at a
private dinner at which Dickens was present,
"Nothing is ever so good as it is thought."  Dickens at
once answered him, "And nothing so bad."  We
remember that few opportunities came to him.
His great career was the result of his own
exertions.  There was no one at all to help him when
he was young.  We think with pride and admiration
of his great achievements, and we love him
for his affectionate nature and goodness of heart.
No one can read Dickens' novels without learning
what his character was, ardent, generous and
loving.  He was a great novelist and a great benefactor.

<h3>
CHAPTER III
<br><br>
WHAT DICKENS DID FOR HUMANITY
</h3>

<p>
Dickens from his childhood seems to have
had a strong desire to leave the world a
better place for other people than he had found
it for himself.  We can trace this feeling in his
youth and through his manhood.  It runs in his
novels like a great tide of impulse and energy.
"These things should not happen" he seems to
cry to the world.  "Come, let us unite against
injustice and heartlessness in public and private
dealing, against public and private wrong of every
description.  Let us banish bad customs from the
earth, so that it may be a fairer, brighter,
happier place."
</p>

<p>
One of his novels<i> A Tale of Two Cities</i> is a
story of the French Revolution.  The story shows
that, in common with the rest of the world then
living, Dickens' outlook on life had been
powerfully affected by the French Revolution, as our
world to-day has been vastly changed by the Great
War.  The watch words of the French Revolution
were Liberty, Fraternity, Equality.  They rang
like bells to waken all men's hearts against
injustice; their echoes are ringing still.  During
the Revolution which began in 1789, a little more
than twenty years before Dickens was born, and in
the years following the Revolution, there were
terrible excesses of cruelty, murder and bloodshed
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P17"></a>17}</span>
by the revolutionists.  But the spirit of
revolt against wrong was in men's minds
everywhere.  In every country change and revolution
were impending, either violent change and revolution
with bloodshed, or silent change and a peaceful
revolution.  In Great Britain, it appears
reasonably certain that the works of Dickens had
much to do with preventing a violent revolution.
Well-to-do people read these books, and their
minds became more kindly to their fellowmen.
They were eager to help the poor and oppressed.
The poor and unfortunate read Dickens' stories
and were filled with the spirit of brotherhood to
everyone, to the rich as well as to those who were
poor as they themselves were poor.  Dickens
showed, not that the poor were unhappy, but that
they were unjustly and harshly treated.  The
living spirit of happiness and of Christmas is found
in the house of the Cratchits.  The Cratchits are
poor, but they are wonderfully happy.  People
in many other countries as well as England rushed
to the help of the poor because of the happiness
of the Cratchit family.  Tiny Tim and his crutch
touched the heart of the world, and the heart of
the world was made the better for it.  We still
are made better by the story of the Cratchits.
Above all, Dickens' novels overflow, not only with
tenderness and indignation against wrong and
cruelty, but with abounding good temper and
inexhaustible mirth.  It has been said that danger
of a violent revolution in Great Britain was swept
away by the gales of good-tempered and hearty
laughter which seized upon thousands of people
who were reading these great stories.  It was a
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P18"></a>18}</span>
splendid achievement for any novelist, or for any
man or woman.  To help to bring about a peaceful
revolution, instead of one in which blood is
shed, is a claim that can be made on behalf of few
people in the history of the world.
</p>

<p>
Dickens is generally given credit for having
secured for the world a number of much needed
reforms.  There is no doubt that Dickens had a
great deal to do with promoting these reforms.
But it is the glory of the age in which he lived
that many people were working to make wrong
conditions right.  What Dickens succeeded in
doing, possibly in a greater degree than anyone else
at that time, was to produce in a great multitude
of people the spirit which is willing, more than
willing, very desirous, to make wrong right.
</p>

<p>
An English poet who was born about a half
century before Dickens, (Dickens' dates are
1812-1870; William Blake's dates are 1757-1827) wrote
lines which embody wonderfully this passion for
helping other people who need help.  It is a
passion which happily belongs to our own age.  Who
can tell how many people now living carry about
in their hearts the resolution expressed in one of
Blake's verses?
</p>

<p class="poem">
  I will not cease from mental fight,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor shall my sword sleep in my hand,<br>
  Till we have built Jerusalem<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In England's green and pleasant land.<br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
Jerusalem, of course, means heaven.  The Lord's
Prayer says, Thy will be done on earth as it is in
heaven.
</p>

<p>
You had better learn by heart this verse written
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P19"></a>19}</span>
by William Blake, for you will often want to
remember it, and to help to build Jerusalem in
your own country, wherever that country is.
</p>

<p>
Charles Dickens has other claims to greatness,
but surely none so compelling as the fact that the
spirit of his novels is the aspiring, tender, loving
spirit of humanity.
</p>

<p>
It is interesting to know the names of the
special reforms for which Dickens worked.  These
were to change the customs of the law courts so
that there should be less delay and greater
simplicity in securing redress for hardship, and to
improve the character of the men appointed to
the bench; to change the Poor Laws, and especially
to improve their administration; to change
and improve greatly the schools which existed
at that time; and to bring about a reformation in
the administration of prisons.  Finally, he wished
to have the nation provide common means of
decency and health in the dwellings of the poor, so
that fever and consumption should not forever be
let loose on God's creatures.  These are almost
Dickens' own words.  All these conditions have
been so vastly improved that we who are living
to-day can hardly realize how much we have for
which to be thankful.  But there are still in the
world wrongs to right and conditions to improve.
</p>

<p>
Dickens was a great novelist, but he was not a
perfect novelist.  It is easy to find defects in the
books that he wrote, defects of style, faults in the
plans of his novels and in the delineation of his
characters.  But in spite of these defects, his
novels are great novels.  It is possible that Dickens'
characters are more true to life than we have
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P20"></a>20}</span>
thought they were.  He may be one of the greatest
delineators of English character in the history
of literature.  Can you not imagine Sam Weller,
and Mark Tapley, yes, and Tom Pinch, and Ham
Peggotty, Tupman, Winkle and Snodgrass, fighting
in the trenches in France and Flanders, with
bravery, jokes and indomitable perseverance,
while Boffin, Mr. Pickwick, Miss Betsey Trotwood
and Susan Nipper are busy with work at home?
One of the best ways, and certainly one of the most
delightful ways, to study the character and the
genius of the people of England is to read the
novels of Charles Dickens.

CHAPTER IV
<br><br>
THE WAVERLEY NOVELS
</h3>

<p>
You have heard at times a strain of music
far away.  A band, perhaps, is playing the
air of some martial song that you know
well.  The music comes nearer, nearer.  You can
almost imagine that you see the players marching
down the street.  And here they are.  As
stirring, as romantic, as beautiful as the distant
music, are the spirit, scenes, and happenings of
The Waverley Novels by Sir Walter Scott.
</p>

<p>
Scott did not begin by writing novels; his first
writing was poetical; he wrote stories in verse.
If you do not already know these poetical stories,
you probably will some day soon, because they are
charming and delightful, and so easy to read that
one almost feels one must have read them before
in a dream.  The novels are, perhaps, a little more
difficult to follow, but not after we once get fairly
started.  They are wonderful books to read.
Some of them are world novels.  This means that
in many countries, and in many different
languages, people may be found reading the
Waverley Novels.  This statement is true of Dickens'
novels also.  When we learn to know Dickens'
work and Scott's work intimately, we will
perceive that there is a difference.
</p>

<p>
Let us begin with <i>Rob Roy</i>, one of the Waverley
Novels which is a great favourite with boys
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P22"></a>22}</span>
and girls.  Francis Osbaldistone is sent by his
father to visit his uncle, Sir Hildebrand, at the
family seat, Osbaldistone Hall, in the north of
England.  Frank does not want to go into business
and become his father's successor.  The visit
to Osbaldistone Hall is by way of punishment.
His father means to choose one of Frank's six
cousins to inherit his place in the business.  Frank
goes north, meets all the six cousins, his uncle,
Sir Hildebrand, Andrew Fairservice, a serving
man, who is as notable a character after his own
way of life as Sam Weller; and above all he meets
a cousin of his cousins, Die Vernon, beautiful,
spirited, altogether charming and lovable Die.
</p>

<p>
Owing to a business matter, Frank has to go
further north from Osbaldistone Hall into
Scotland.  In the city of Glasgow, he is directed to
Bailie Nicol Jarvie.  He is given a mysterious
warning in Glasgow Cathedral, and goes up to the
Highlands with Bailie Nicol Jarvie, seeking to
recover a debt.  Now we are fully set in the midst
of the scenes of Sir Walter Scott's enchantment.
The wild, romantic, beautiful scenery of Scotland,
painted by a master's hand; the Highlanders
themselves, proud, devoted, chivalrous, faithful;
the cause of the royal Stuarts whose adherents
loved them and sacrificed for them without stint;
the glamour of old Scots songs; romantic stories
of love and conflict, all these delights you will find
in <i>Rob Roy</i> and in other of the Waverley Novels.
The mysterious Mr. Campbell of the highroad and
the drove of cattle, turns out to be Rob Roy
MacGregor himself.  His wife, Helen, who is as fierce
as she is heroic, is the central figure of one of the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P23"></a>23}</span>
most dramatic actions of the story.  Escape, danger,
flight, battle, the allurement of a lost cause,
striking characters for whom one forms a romantic
attachment, are all gathered within the pages
of this novel.
</p>

<p>
<i>Kenilworth</i> and <i>Ivanhoe</i> will prove themselves
as fascinating as <i>Rob Roy</i>.  <i>Kenilworth</i> is written
of the time of Queen Elizabeth and tells the
story of the beautiful, unfortunate Amy Robsart,
the wife of the Earl of Leicester, Queen
Elizabeth's favourite.  Amy, who had made a secret,
runaway match, is sought by Tressilian on behalf
of her father.  She lives in hiding at Cumnor
Hall, waited on by Janet Foster and her father,
Anthony Foster.  Seeking redress for Amy, we
go with Tressilian to find Leicester at the great
castle of Kenilworth to which Elizabeth makes
one of her royal progresses.  On the way we meet
Wayland Smith, and Flibbertigibbet, and we learn
what black magic means.
</p>

<p>
At Kenilworth are stirring scenes.  We encounter
Raleigh, Spenser, an astrologer, and scores of
brightly coloured, romantic figures.  We are
present at a pageant, and see Elizabeth conferring
knighthood on some of Leicester's men.  All the
while, Amy Robsart is to be vindicated, later Amy
is to be saved.  But, partly through misunderstanding,
yet also by cowardice, cruelty and falsehood,
Amy is betrayed.  <i>Kenilworth</i> is notable
for its scenes from English history, but the story
of Amy Robsart, after we read it for the first
time, leaves something in our memories that in
all likelihood had not been there before, something
gentle, full of pity, and precious.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P24"></a>24}</span>
</p>

<p>
<i>Ivanhoe</i> is more robust and exciting.  Read the
opening scene between Gurth, the swineherd, and
Wamba, the jester.  This is Merrie England of
long ago, when Saxons and Normans were still
hostile and separate, although living together in
the heart of England.  John had usurped the
throne from King Richard, his brother, who had
been fighting on Crusade in the Holy Land.  Here
in the greenwood we meet Friar Tuck, and various
knights.  We visit Rotherwood, and listen to
Cedric, the Saxon master of Gurth and Wamba.  We
see the beautiful Rowena.  We meet the Jew,
Isaac of York and his lovely daughter Rebecca.
There are great combats for knights to prove
their knighthood at Ashby-de-la-Zouche.  There
is the thrilling siege of the castle, Torquilstone.
We discover who the Black Knight is, and, best of
all, we encounter, in many disguises and lastly as
himself, Robin Hood.  Read the account of the
archery contest in chapter thirteen.  Every word
is thrilling.  If we could go back through the
centuries, we, too, would visit Merrie England, walk
in the greenwood and taste the venison pasty in
Friar Tuck's cell, watch while Locksley shot his
arrows, and with Rebecca on the ramparts,
follow the course of the great siege of Torquilstone.
But, thanks to the genius of Sir Walter, we can
see these happenings in imagination without
leaving the twentieth century, although the novel
Ivanhoe was published more than a hundred years
ago.
</p>

<p>
Scott wrote more than twenty novels, and other
books as well.  The chief of the Waverley Novels,
beside the three already named, are <i>Waverley</i>,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P25"></a>25}</span>
<i>Guy Mannering</i>, <i>The Antiquary</i>, <i>Old Mortality</i>,
<i>The Bride of Lammermoor</i>, <i>The Heart of
Mid-Lothian</i>, <i>The Fortunes of Nigel</i>, <i>Redgauntlet</i>,
<i>Anne of Geierstein</i>, <i>Woodstock</i>, and <i>The Fair
Maid of Perth</i>.
</p>

<p>
Thrilling and romantically beautiful as <i>Rob
Roy</i>, <i>Kenilworth</i> and <i>Ivanhoe</i> are, and exciting as
it is to read them, Scott has achieved even greater
scenes in some of the novels appearing in the list
above.  Rob Roy, Die Vernon, Locksley, Rebecca
of York, are splendid and memorable characters,
but they are not as wonderful as Edie Ochiltree
in <i>The Antiquary</i>, or as Jeanie Deans in <i>The
Heart of Mid-Lothian</i>.  We delight in Rob Roy
and Locksley and we love Die Vernon dearly, and
yet somehow we know that Edie Ochiltree and
Jeanie Deans are greater.  We respect them
profoundly, and think more of human nature because
of what they say and do.  We wonder why this
should be so.  Puzzling out the way we feel about
Edie Ochiltree and Jeanie Deans, we come to a
conclusion somewhat like the following.  In the
case of the first dearly loved characters, Scott was
writing about people he had never met or known.
He was in reality describing the beautiful dreams
we have of romantic people who do not actually
belong to everyday life.  But Edie Ochiltree is
such a man as Scott himself must have known.  He
is alive and so vivid in his not too highly coloured
perfection, that one can imagine him strolling
along a country road in Scotland.  Edie is a
wandering beggar and wears a blue gown.  The
neighbours give him food and shelter, and in return
he does for them various little services.  But Edie
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P26"></a>26}</span>
at the same time is a remarkable man.  When
greatness comes in ordinary people, they are
greater than it is possible to make a romantic
character.  We cannot tell why this is so; but so
it is.
</p>

<p>
Turn to chapter seven in <i>The Antiquary</i> and
read what Edie says in answer to Sir Arthur
Wardour's offer of a reward if he will save his
daughter and himself from drowning.  Such a
character as Edie shows himself to be is an example of
Sir Walter's genius at its highest.  You will find
other remarkable scenes in which Edie speaks in
chapter twenty.  But from his final appearance
in chapter forty-four we must quote a few lines.
There is a rumour that the country is to be
invaded, and someone says to Edie that he has not
much to fight for.  Read carefully what follows
for it is written in one of the dialects of Scotland,
as is the case with a good part of what Sir Walter
has written.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Me</i> no muckle to fight for, sir?&mdash;isna there the
country to fight for, and the burnsides that I gang
daundering beside, and the hearths of the gudewives
that gie me my bit bread, and the bits o'
weans that come toddling to play wi' me when
I come about a landward town?&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Here love of country and love of people,&mdash;little
children and men and women&mdash;are joined, and
Edie's words express the highest feelings for
home and country that we have.  There is
something in every boy and every girl that thrills to
this reply of Edie Ochiltree, who had no money
and no land, but who was rich in his spirit
nevertheless.  It is for such reasons as this that we
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P27"></a>27}</span>
judge Edie's character to be one of Scott's
greatest achievements.
</p>

<p>
Some day you may read in <i>The Heart of Mid-Lothian</i>
of how Jeanie Deans walked many weary
miles to London to plead with Queen Caroline for
the life of her sister.  You will learn to admire
and reverence Jeanie when at the last she says to
the Queen that "when the hour of trouble comes
to the mind or to the body ... then it isna what we
hae dune for oursells, but what we hae dune for
others, that we think on maist pleasantly."  Jeanie's
is a sad story, and yet it turns out happily.
Scott's genius for story telling, as well as
for the delineation of character, was singularly
rich and ample.
</p>

<p>
To the contents of these novels, Scott added
occasionally a short story, and often beautiful
songs.  In <i>Redgauntlet</i>, chapter eleven, you will
find Wandering Willie's Tale, one of the greatest
short stories that ever has been written.  The
Ballad of the Red Harlaw is in <i>The Antiquary</i>,
the same novel in which Edie Ochiltree appears.
One of the most beautiful songs in Scottish literature,
which is rich in exquisite songs, is "Proud
Maisie"; this song is to be found in <i>The Heart of
Mid-Lothian</i>, chapter thirty-nine.  Those of you
who are fond of learning poetry by heart will find
time well spent in learning "Proud Maisie".  Only
when genius is most richly endowed can it be so
generous in its giving as Scott is in his novels
with his songs.

<h3>
CHAPTER V
<br><br>
SCOTT'S OWN STORY
</h3>

<p>
Walter Scott was born August 15th,
1771, in a house belonging to his father
at the head of the College Wynd in Edinburgh,
Scotland.  The family was well-to-do and
happily situated.  But when he was eighteen
months old, the little lad had a serious illness
which left him a cripple.  Every effort was made
to cure his lameness.  He was sent to live with
his grand-parents on the farm at Sandy Knowe,
but while he gained strength, he was slow in
learning to walk and his left leg remained shrunken.
He grew up tall and strong, unusually good
looking and attractive.  When he was a man he
thought nothing of walking thirty miles in a day.
Apparently, his lameness had no influence upon
his character, except that it helped to make him
considerate.  His biographer says that he was
always tender to those who had any bodily misfortune.
</p>

<p>
Edinburgh is a beautiful city.  Those who belong
to it love their romantic town with devotion.
But it was fortunate for Walter Scott, and for us
also, that he spent some of his early years on a
farm.  What he saw and learned at that time
influenced all his future life.  A story is told that
when he was three years old, and unable to help
himself, because he was so lame, he was left alone
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P29"></a>29}</span>
in the open air at some distance from the farmhouse,
as his aunt often wisely left him.  A thunder
storm came up and when they hastened to the
little fellow they found him lying on his back,
clapping his hands at each flash of lightning, and
crying out, "Bonny! bonny!"  There was never
anything lacking in Walter Scott's happy courage,
or in his tranquil enjoyment of the beauties
he saw in nature or read about in books.
</p>

<p>
His aunt used to read aloud to him.  Like some
other boys one has known, he played out by
himself the battles described as he imagined they
might have been fought.  He was fascinated by
old tales, old ballads and by history.  From his
early manhood he had a passion for all kinds of
antiquarian research.  When he was a lad he was
sent to Edinburgh High School, a famous school,
and here after school hours and during recess he
became known to the other boys as a wonderful
adept at relating stories.  His audiences were
closely attentive and delighted.  He says of
himself in a short fragment of autobiography that he
was not a dunce, "but an incorrigibly idle imp".
Perhaps his chief pursuit was reading.  Some
of the books he read were Ossian, which is
compact of Highland myth and story, Spenser, an
exquisite English poet, many novelists and other
Poets, and the great collection of ballads known
as Percy's <i>Reliques of Ancient Poetry</i>.  These
are all manly books, and stir the reader's blood
and imagination, as Sir Philip Sidney said, like
the sound of a trumpet.
</p>

<p>
After Edinburgh High School and Edinburgh
University, where boys went at that time when
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P30"></a>30}</span>
they were very young, Scott became a lawyer.  The
study of Scots law was to him an unending source
of interest.  But when he was a young lawyer
without much to do, he was in the habit of telling
romances to other young lawyers like himself who
were waiting for clients.  As the boys at school
used to be fascinated, so the young lawyers later
came under the same spell.
</p>

<p>
We have by this time the origins of Scott's
great work, a natural and unconquerable genius
for writing and romance, love for romantic
Edinburgh and all Scotland, the farm at Sandy Knowe,
ballads, tales and history, Scots law, old customs,
the characters and the people whom he knew and
loved.
</p>

<p>
He began by translating songs from other languages,
then by editing and publishing old ballads
and songs belonging to his own country, what is
called minstrelsy, the songs of wandering poets.
His first book, <i>Minstrelsy of the Border</i>, was
published very early in the nineteenth century.  He
married, in 1797, Miss Charpentier, the daughter
of a refugee from the French Revolution.  They
lived in a cottage at Lasswade, six miles from
Edinburgh.  Later, their home was at Ashestiel,
also in the country, an old house on the south bank
of the Tweed.  His own first writing, a poetical
story, <i>The Lay of the Last Minstrel</i>, was
published in 1805.  He held during his life various
law offices under the Crown, beginning as Sheriff
Depute, then Sheriff, and later a Clerk of the
Court of Session.  Although he wrote many books
he made a point of keeping other employment, so
writing might be, as he said, not a bad crutch, but
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P31"></a>31}</span>
a good staff.  But by 1805, it was plain that
literature was to be his main occupation.
</p>

<p>
Scott had a singularly affectionate nature,
which in itself is almost sufficient to make a happy
life.  With his first fee as a lawyer, he bought a
silver taper stand for his mother's desk.  Lockhart
writes of him, "No man cared less about popular
admiration and applause; but for the least
chill on the affection of any near and dear to him
he had the sensitiveness of a maiden."  We find
as we learn to know people that powers of
affection and love for those who belong to them are
marks of the finest natures.
</p>

<p>
Scott was considerate of the feelings of everyone,
and he was greatly loved.  He made much
money by his writings, first by his romantic verse
which took the world by storm, and later by the
long series of great novels, which were published
at first anonymously, and only acknowledged by
Scott as his own with reluctance years after he
began publishing them.  With his love for beautiful
scenery, for Scotland, and for everything belonging
to dignified and delightful ways of living, it
was natural that Scott, from the result of his
labours, should buy an estate and build on it a
castle called Abbotsford.  Here he lived with his
family, dealing bountifully and kindly with many
dependents and followers.  He had tender care
for all his neighbours, gentle and simple, as the
old phrase runs.  Scott valued what he had
because it gave him the power to be good to other
people.  "Sir Walter speaks to every man as if
they were blood relations" was the description
given of his manner by one of the men who worked
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P32"></a>32}</span>
on his estate to an inquirer.  Tom Purdie, a
personal attendant, had been a salmon poacher, and
was one of Scott's great friends.
</p>

<p>
It is difficult to give a sufficiently convincing
picture of his happy, beneficient, affectionate life,
spent in beautiful surroundings, in friendliness
and family joys, and yet at the same time do
justice to Scott's incessant toil.  He worked
unstintedly, and he loved his work.  He was so popular
and famous, it seemed all he had to do was to sit
down and write a novel and the world would ring
with its fame.  But Scott was at work generally
before six o'clock in the morning.  He was a man
of remarkable industry as well as of unusual gifts.
Yet, those who knew him, noticed first and valued
most his kindness and simplicity.
</p>

<p>
There are two books in which we can find details
of the character and the life of Scott.  These
are <i>The Life of Sir Walter Scott</i>, written by his
son-in-law, J. G. Lockhart, and Scott's <i>Journal</i>,
written by himself, and meant only for his own
reading.
</p>

<p>
He was a man of great reasonableness and common
sense.  Lord Cockburn, a distinguished lawyer,
who was a friend, said that in his opinion
Walter Scott's sense was a still more wonderful
thing than his genius.  He did not care to talk
much about his writing, but rather of what he had
done or seen.  There was so little made of Scott's
writing in his home, either by himself or anyone
else, that his children did not know much about it.
Someone asked Sophia, his eldest daughter, how
she liked one of his books.  Her answer was that
she had not read it.  Walter, the eldest boy, came
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P33"></a>33}</span>
home from school one day, plainly showing signs
of having been in a fight, and said that the other
boys had called him a "lassie".  One of the boys
had said something about <i>The Lady of the Lake</i>,
and he was unaware that there was a book of that
name written by his father.  These incidents are
related to show how simple and natural were
Scott's ideas of himself and his work.  He was a
rapid, even at times a careless, writer, but he was
incontestably a great writer.  He was, however,
greater as a man.
</p>

<p>
No one can read his life without being charmed
by Scott's love for his dogs.  Cats, too, were
favourites in the family circle.  All the domestic
creatures were as fond of Scott as he was of them.
You will find in Lockhart's <i>Life</i>, chapter nine, a
description by Washington Irving, the American
author, of a visit to Abbotsford, and of Scott and
his dogs.  It is, perhaps, as vivid a picture as has
ever been drawn of Scott.
</p>

<p>
During the last years of his life, Scott undertook
the payment of a heavy debt.  He had been
partner in a publishing enterprise which was
conducted with far too little reasonable caution in
entering upon undertakings and expenditure.
Although Scott was not an active partner, and
unfortunately had not informed himself about the
firm's transactions, he was liable for the full
amount of the debt.  He refused to become a
bankrupt and set himself the enormous task of
paying every creditor in full.  This last labour of
his life is a heroic story.  Friends, some of them
unknown friends, offered him money.  His sense
of honour was so high that he would allow no mitigation
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P34"></a>34}</span>
of his task.  He laboured single-handed
and paid back large sums to his creditors.  The
final payments were arranged only after his
death.  He had cut down his way of living at
Abbotsford.  He allowed himself little rest and no
luxury.  Any boy who reads this story will learn
from it something of the nature of business and
of what is wise and right in business dealings.
He will learn to love too, as we all may, Sir
Walter's radiant sense of the beauty of honour.
</p>

<p>
We discover at last the true reason why the
characters in Scott's novels are great.  It is
because he is himself great and noble, with such a
nobility that in all likelihood the world will keep
him always as one of its heroes.  His last words
to his son-in-law, Lockhart, "My dear, be a good
man", come into the minds of many people every
now and then as they live their daily lives and
bring them help and encouragement.  We read
Scott's novels because they tell thrilling and
romantic stories; and we read them again for their
nobility, high-mindedness, dignity and beauty.

<h3>
CHAPTER VI
<br><br>
THE TEMPEST AND OTHER OF SHAKESPEARE'S PLAYS
</h3>

<p>
Shakespeare, as you know, wrote plays.
Here is the story of one of these plays:
Prospero, an old man, and his daughter,
Miranda, a very beautiful girl, lived alone on an
island in the sea far from any known land.  Their
only dwelling was a cell made in a rock; probably
the cell was really a cave in the rock.  Now
Prospero was a duke in exile, the Duke of Milan
in Italy, and Miranda was a princess, his only
child.
</p>

<p>
Prospero was a very clever man and a great
student.  He had had in Milan a younger brother,
Antonio, to whom he trusted all his affairs so that
he might give his time wholly to study.
Prospero's special study was magic.  Shakespeare
wrote this play very early in the seventeenth
century: <i>The Tempest</i>, therefore, is more than three
hundred years old.
</p>

<p>
Antonio conspired against his brother Prospero,
and in this conspiracy he was aided by the
King of Naples.  Prospero and Miranda, then a
baby, were kidnapped, carried on board a ship
and later cast adrift in a small boat.  Finally, the
sea carried them to this island.  A kind nobleman,
Gonzalo, had concealed on the little boat, water,
food, clothing and some books, which were
Prospero's books of magic.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P36"></a>36}</span>
</p>

<p>
Prospero and Miranda lived for years on the
island.  During this time her father took care of
Miranda and educated her.  Now the island was
an enchanted island which had been placed under
a spell by a witch called Sycorax, who had died
shortly before Prospero and Miranda came to the
island, leaving a son who was a misshapen dwarf
called Caliban.  Prospero found this dwarf, and
tried to teach him how to speak and how to do
useful work, but Caliban was not able to learn
much.  Perhaps he was not very willing to learn.
</p>

<p>
The witch Sycorax, before she died, had
imprisoned in trees on the island many good spirits,
because they would not obey her commands; since
they were gentle spirits and Sycorax had tried to
get them to do cruel and wicked deeds.  Prospero
found these good spirits and released them from
their prisons.  The chief of these spirits was
Ariel.  You will love Ariel very much when you
read about him in the play.
</p>

<p>
Now we have the island, Prospero and Miranda,
Ariel and a host of other gentle spirits, and
Caliban, whose only idea of God was that there was
something more powerful than he was himself.
But Caliban thought his god must be cruel, hard
and unkind as well as strong, since he did not
know any better.  This idea he had of a god he
called Setebos.
</p>

<p>
Prospero was able to work magic.  Three
hundred years ago some people believed in magic.
Prospero, since he was a good man, never wanted
to work anything but good with his magic; and he
used Ariel and the other gentle spirits whom he
had released from prison to carry out his
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P37"></a>37}</span>
commands.  <i>The Tempest</i>, you will understand by
this time, is a good deal like what we call a fairy
tale.  But fairy tales are lovely things.
</p>

<p>
The King of Naples, his son Ferdinand, Antonio,
who had usurped his brother's place as
Duke of Milan, and a number of noblemen, including
kind Gonzalo, when the play begins had been
on a voyage on a ship.  Prospero by his magic
raised a great storm, and commanded Ariel to
bring the ship to the island where it was to be
shipwrecked, but everyone on board was to be
brought to shore safe and unharmed.
</p>

<p>
Prospero's plan was that Ferdinand, who was
an admirable young prince, and his dear and
beautiful daughter Miranda, should fall in love with
one another.  Further, he planned by this
shipwreck that Antonio should be punished and he
himself restored to the Dukedom of Milan.  In
the play, we see and hear all these things happening.
Prospero's plans are carried out exactly as
he directed.  Ferdinand and Miranda find each
other so beautiful and attractive that at first sight
they fall in love.  Antonio is confronted with his
wrong doing.  Gonzalo finds reward and praise.
Prospero is again Duke of Milan, buries his books
and magic garment and gives up magic forever.
The king of Naples repents his misdoing, and
is only too happy for his son Ferdinand to marry
Miranda.  And most joyous of all these happenings,
the gentle Ariel and his companions, having
served Prospero well, regain full liberty, and fly
away to wander free in islands where beautiful
trees and flowers grow, there to live happy all the
long day.

We cannot help wondering how Shakespeare
came to write this play about a far away, unknown,
enchanted island.  It is almost certain that
people have been able to make a very good guess
at the origin of the story.  <i>The Tempest</i> was written
in 1610 or 1611.  In 1609, a British fleet,
commanded by Sir George Somers, which had sailed
for the new plantation of Jamestown in Virginia,
met a great storm in the West Indies.  The
Admiral's ship, the <i>Sea-Venture</i>, was driven on the
coast of one of the unknown Bermuda Isles.  The
sailors had to stay there for ten months.  Finally,
they escaped in two boats which they made out of
cedar logs, and in these boats they managed to
reach Virginia.  When these sailors returned to
London in 1610, there was great excitement; one
person would report to another their marvellous
stories.  The island had been over-run with wild
pigs, and the sailors said they had heard odd
noises.  Therefore, they concluded that the island
was enchanted.  Shakespeare, who was writing
his wonderful plays at the time, is likely to have
heard these stories; and he made use of the sailors'
tales of enchantment in a strange, beautiful,
fairy-like play.
</p>

<p>
Shakespeare's plays are printed, so that we can
read them in books.  They are also, of course,
acted in theatres.  Some of you may have seen
one of Shakespeare's plays, or more than one,
acted on a stage.  As you grow older, you will
have opportunities, let us hope, to see great actors
in Shakespeare's plays.  For, since the plays are
so great themselves, they can only be acted
properly by great actors.  You can always read these
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P39"></a>39}</span>
plays in books, however; and some of Shakespeare's
plays seem almost better when they are
read than when they are acted.  The reason for
this is that we can imagine scenes more vividly
sometimes than we can see them when other
people try to show them to us.
</p>

<p>
One of the best ways to read Shakespeare is to
take a scene from one of his plays, such as the
Casket scene in <i>The Merchant of Venice</i>, assign
the characters to different people, boys and girls,
or men and women, and then read the scene aloud,
each character speaking in his turn.  You will
enjoy the reading better if someone first tells the
complete story of the play.
</p>

<p>
The whole world highly regards, and very many
people dearly love, Shakespeare's plays.  There
are many of them.  Some of the plays to choose
first for reading are, <i>The Merchant of Venice</i>,
<i>Julius Caesar</i>, scenes from <i>A Midsummer Night's
Dream</i>, from <i>As You Like It</i>, <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>
and <i>Twelfth Night</i>.  How delightful you will find
the fairy scenes in <i>A Midsummer Night's Dream</i>,
and the scenes in the forest from <i>As You Like It</i>.
</p>

<p>
<i>Julius Caesar</i> is a political play.  Politics, as
you know, is one of the great pursuits of men; and
more recently, political questions are becoming of
importance to women.  Politics is not a way to
earn one's living, like farming, or being a doctor,
or an engineer; but it offers one of the chief
avenues by which one may serve one's country.
<i>Julius Caesar</i>, besides being a very interesting story,
is a splendidly wise and clear picture of how men
and women are influenced by political questions
and actions.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P40"></a>40}</span>
</p>

<p>
Shakespeare wrote and put into his plays numbers
of very beautiful songs.  They are so beautiful
and natural that to read them is almost like
listening to the song of a bird.  In <i>The Tempest</i>
you will find Ariel's songs, "Come unto these
yellow sands", "Full fathom five thy father lies",
and "Where the bee sucks, there suck I".  There
are songs in <i>A Midsummer Night's Dream</i>.
Amiens in <i>As You Like It</i>, sings "Under the
greenwood tree", and "Blow, blow, thou winter
wind".  "It was a lover and his lass" comes near
the end of the play.  <i>Twelfth Night</i>, too, is rich in
songs, "O mistress mine, where are you roaming?",
"Come away, come away, death"; the play
ends with the inimitable, "When that I was and
a little tiny boy".
</p>

<p>
Shakespeare is as great in the poetry of his
plays as he is in their dramatic action.  He had
the power so to suit his thoughts with words that
our minds are filled and enriched with life and
beauty.  Read Prospero's great speech which you
will find in <i>The Tempest</i>, act iv, scene i.

<h3>
CHAPTER VII
<br><br>
SHAKESPEARE&mdash;THE GREAT WORLD ITSELF
</h3>

<p>
Shakespeare lived at a time when people,
as a rule, did not write and print the
details of famous men's lives while they
were living or soon after their deaths.  We know
much of the daily lives of such people as Scott
and Dickens, and many others like Queen Victoria,
Napoleon, Lincoln, Disraeli, Gladstone.  But
we know comparatively little about Shakespeare,
partly because many people during his lifetime
thought of him only as a play actor and writer of
plays, and partly because there were at that time
few books and there was little reading.  Incidents
of history and in the lives of men and women were
told by older people to their children.  These
stories were remembered and repeated and served
instead of printed books.  Such traditional
knowledge is sometimes inaccurate, but it is generally
interesting, and frequently true.
</p>

<p>
We know that Shakespeare was born April 22nd
or 23rd, 1564, in Stratford-on-Avon, Warwickshire,
England.  He was baptised on April 26th
of that year; his baptism is on record.  He died
on his birthday, April 23rd, 1616, fifty-two years
later.
</p>

<p>
His father was John Shakespeare, who sold
farm produce in Stratford, and his mother was
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P42"></a>42}</span>
Mary Arden, who came of what are called gentlefolk.
He was married in 1582 to Anne Hathaway.
They had three children, Susanna, Hamnet and
Judith.  Susanna later married John Hall, a
doctor of medicine; and Judith married Thomas
Quiney, a vintner, in the same year that her father
died.  But Hamnet died in 1596; his death was a
heavy grief to Shakespeare.
</p>

<p>
Shakespeare went to London probably in 1586.
The story told by tradition is that he had been
poaching on a neighbouring estate belonging to a
Sir Thomas Lucy.  In any case, he left Stratford
and journeyed to London, a small London, very
different from the great city of to-day; nevertheless,
it must have been an interesting place.  Shakespeare
acted, and wrote plays.  By 1593, he had
achieved a noted success.  Four years later, 1597,
he bought New Place, the finest house in Stratford.
At first, he paid a visit there only once a
year.  Then he left London, and spent his later
years in Stratford at New Place.  His custom was
to write two of his plays each year.
</p>

<p>
We know something of Shakespeare's character
from what his contemporaries said of him.  We
know what interested him most, and probably
what he cared about most, from his plays.  He
was most frequently called by other people the
gentle Shakespeare.  For a man of great genius
who was busy making wonderful plays, and who
could have met few people, if any, who were his
intellectual equals, to be called gentle by everyone
who knew him is a great tribute to the lovableness
of his disposition and the sweetness of his
temper.  It shows that he must have been
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P43"></a>43}</span>
courteous, patient and considerate.  We know from
his writings that he was a well-balanced man.  He
was genial, and he had a great zest for life.
</p>

<p>
He seems to have been fond of many different
kinds of characters.  Men of action, that is, men
who do things, and men of thought, whose philosophy
and understanding take hold of the facts
of life and look deep into their meaning, were
equally understood and loved by Shakespeare.
How do we know this?  We know because he created
such thinkers as Hamlet, and his King Richard
II, and Macbeth, and such men of action as
are in his great historical plays and especially
Othello.  But we cannot help thinking that
Shakespeare loved men of action better and was more
devoted to them than he was to those who were
thinkers chiefly.  A critic named Hazlitt wrote of
Shakespeare, "His talent consisted in sympathy
with human nature in all its shapes, degrees,
depressions and elevations."  Sympathy of this
kind is not only a great gift, but it is also a very
rare one.  His universal sympathy is one reason
why we admire Shakespeare so much.
</p>

<p>
There are other facts about Shakespeare's life
that we learn from his plays.  His youth was
brilliant, full of happy exuberance and exaltation,
confident and swift.  At this time, he wrote such
plays as <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>, 1592, the great historical
plays, 1592-1594, and again in 1597-1598, <i>A
Midsummer Night's Dream</i>, 1594-5, <i>As You Like
It</i>, 1599, <i>Twelfth Night</i>, 1600, <i>Julius Caesar</i>, 1600.
You do not need to remember these dates, but
notice how rapidly one great play follows another.
</p>

<p>
Shakespeare's full maturity, following youth,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P44"></a>44}</span>
begins about 1599.  Later than 1600, he wrote
such plays as <i>Hamlet</i>, 1602, <i>Othello</i>, 1604,
<i>Macbeth</i>, 1606, <i>King Lear</i>, 1607, <i>Anthony and
Cleopatra</i>, 1608.  These are generally regarded as his
greatest plays.
</p>

<p>
In the last years of his life we can think of him
as living at New Place in Stratford, with peace,
happiness and tranquility.  His young daughter
Judith must have been his special, much-loved
companion.  We imagine that possibly Miranda
in <i>The Tempest</i> is like Judith; Shakespeare may
have been thinking of himself a little when he
wrote some of Prospero's speeches.  To this
period belong three calm, wise and beautiful plays
which were the last that he wrote, <i>Cymbeline</i>,
1610, <i>The Winter's Tale</i>, 1611, and <i>The Tempest</i>,
1611.
</p>

<p>
Where did Shakespeare obtain his marvelous
knowledge of life and people?  The answer
evidently is, from life itself and from people
themselves.  He studied people and understood them.
His own heart and nature taught him wonderful
knowledge.  From older people, he heard stories
of the Wars of the Roses.  These stories
undoubtedly gave him his knowledge of warfare,
soldiers, battles and politics.  He read such books as
Holinshed's <i>Chronicles</i>, North's translation of
Plutarch's <i>Lives</i> and translations of the choicest
Italian novels of the time.  He probably had read
Chaucer.  He was familiar with all the writings,
plays, poems, and pamphlets of his contemporaries.
The time when Shakespeare lived was one
of the greatest ages in the history of the world.
He himself makes any age in which he lived a
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P45"></a>45}</span>
great age; but there were living at that time many
other great writers, although not as great as
Shakespeare.  He therefore must have read
much.  He almost certainly was one of the people
who, as we say, can take the whole heart out of
a book at a single reading.
</p>

<p>
It would be foolish to say that it is easy to read
all Shakespeare's plays.  Comparatively few
people, old or young, can understand them
altogether.  But to read those plays that one can
understand is a very great adventure.  We find
in them, even if we do not comprehend everything,
so much that is worth while, great life, beauty,
sweetness, courtesy, benignity, generosity and
honour.
</p>

<p>
There were customs in Shakespeare's day,
points of view, judgments and prejudices, which
the world has outgrown.  We have much to learn
still, but the world to-day is a better place than it
was in the sixteenth century.  We find some
things in Shakespeare's plays that grate on us
harshly, such as the feeling towards Shylock, the
Jew, in <i>The Merchant of Venice</i>.
</p>

<p>
Shakespeare's greatest gift to us is that he
makes us feel and know how wonderful life is.
He puts before us in his plays the whole world,
and we can look at it and see how beautiful it is.
He shows us men and women, and although he
wrote long ago people who read his plays to-day
find his men and women so interesting that we
think ourselves very fortunate if we can see a
great actor play Hamlet or a great actress show
us the way in which charming Rosalind may have
walked and spoken in the forest of Arden.  No
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P46"></a>46}</span>
other writer has ever been able to create such
women characters as Shakespeare.
</p>

<p>
The best and soundest knowledge of Shakespeare
comes slowly.  It is good to read such
speeches in his plays as Brutus' speech in <i>Julius
Caesar</i>, Act iv, scene iii, beginning at the words,
"There is a tide in the affairs of men".  When
we have learned that speech, we may turn to other
words, such as these in <i>King Henry V</i>:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  There is some soul of goodness in things evil,<br>
  Would men observingly distil it out.<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Remember King Henry's saying; it contains
truth which is serviceable to us all.
</p>

<p>
Such words as these, and hundreds of other
lines, are what make Shakespeare, Shakespeare,
someone wonderful and lovable who belongs to
you and to everyone else.
</p>

<p>
Here is another of his songs, a sad one this
time, but very beautiful, from <i>Cymbeline</i>.
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Fear no more the heat o' the sun,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor the furious winter's rages;<br>
  Thou thy worldly task hast done,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Home art gone and ta'en thy wages:<br>
  Golden lads and girls all must,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As chimney-sweepers, come to dust.<br>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Fear no more the frown o' the great;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou are past the tyrant's stroke;<br>
  Care no more to clothe and eat;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To thee the reed is as the oak;<br>
  The sceptre, learning, physic, must<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All follow this and come to dust.<br>
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P47"></a>47}</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Fear no more the lightning-flash,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor the all-dreaded thunder-stone;<br>
  Fear not slander, censure rash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou hast finish'd joy and moan:<br>
  All lovers young, all lovers must<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consign to thee and come to dust.<br>
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER VIII
<br><br>
STORIES FROM THE BIBLE
</h3>

<p>
Suppose someone who had never heard of
the Bible wanted to know what it was, how
could we explain, or describe, its nature and
character, most clearly and truly?  The meaning
of the word Bible is simply the book: the greatest
and most important book in the world.
</p>

<p>
In the first place, the Bible is made up of a
number of other books; there are thirty-nine of these
books in the Old Testament, and twenty-seven in
the New Testament; that is, there are sixty-six
books in the Bible altogether.
</p>

<p>
These parts, or books, are of many different
kinds.  They contain traditions, histories,
genealogies, biographies, songs of victory or love,
hymns, psalms, wise sayings, censures and
encouragements by the prophets of God, dramas, stories,
and essays.  In the New Testament, we find the
gospel story of Christ; annals, which are a simple
form of history; and letters from one person to
another or from one person to a church.
</p>

<p>
Many years ago, some writers used to call the
Bible the Divine Library, <i>Bibliotheca Divina</i>; at
that time, writing generally was in the Latin language.
</p>

<p>
The first book in the Bible, Genesis, as you know
begins by telling about the creation of the world.
The story of the development of mankind
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P49"></a>49}</span>
spiritually,&mdash;-this means in learning to know about
God&mdash;is pictured for us in all the books of the Bible.
Man's knowledge of God grows, from the creation,
slowly but steadily, higher and deeper and
wider; and we read about this growth in the Bible.
Slowly the people of the world lose some of their
ignorance of God, and as they learn of God they
begin to give up, or as the Bible says, they forsake,
their evil practices.  For instance, the practice
of keeping slaves was once followed in all parts
of the known world.  Then, presently, men began
to see that they could not keep other men as
slaves, because a better knowledge of God taught
them that all men are brothers.  But, even yet, in
some parts of the world there are slaves waiting
to be freed.  Mankind's progress towards God
and what is good, told about in the Bible, is still
going on.
</p>

<p>
The revelation of God reaches its consummation
in Christ.  Now, the Old Testament, from
the beginning to the end, is the story of the world
being prepared for the coming of Christ; the New
Testament tells the story of His coming.  We
learn from Christ what God truly is.
</p>

<p>
The Bible tells us of Christ.  This is perhaps
the clearest and simplest answer to the question
as to what the Bible is.  The Bible, because it tells
us of Christ, is intended for every one.  It is
printed in many different languages, and read all
over the world.
</p>

<p>
There are many stories in the Bible, both in the
Old and New Testaments, which we can find and
read for ourselves, interesting and beautiful
stories.  Probably you have read most of them
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P50"></a>50}</span>
already, or have heard them read aloud.  But, as
you know, we like to hear or read a true story
many times, and these are true stories.  A list of
a number of these stories from the Bible is printed
at the end of this chapter, with the names of the
different books in which we find them, and
chapters and verses for each story.
</p>

<p>
Many of the stories, perhaps most of them, are
about boys and girls.  But the first on the list is
the story of how the world was made.  Notice
how splendidly the man who wrote the story
makes clear that it was God who made the world.
Notice too, in the story of the Little Maid, II Kings
chap. v, 1-19, what fine people Naaman, the
Syrian, and his wife, must have been; the happy
relations between them and the people who worked
for them are very evident in the story, and indeed
are used to help in Naaman's cure.
</p>

<p>
The list ends with the history of Paul's voyage
and shipwreck, a wonderful, true story of the sea.

CHAPTER IX
<br><br>
LIVING WATERS
</h3>

<p>
About ten million copies of the Bible are
circulated in a year; this means so many
copies either are bought, or given to people
without payment, yearly.  The reason for
such a great and constant demand for the Bible
by all kinds of people is because they find in it
something they need.  What they find is spiritual
life, life for the soul.
</p>

<p>
It is interesting to know something about the
authorized English translation of the Bible.  The
books of the Bible, as you know, were not first
written in English.  Those who wrote the books
of the Bible, except possibly in one or two
instances, were Jews.  Copies of the books of the
Bible, before the fifteenth century, had to be
written by hand.  Following the invention of
printing in the first part of the fifteenth
century, the Bible was one of the first books to
be printed.  But still, there were few books and
there was little reading.  Books of any kind
were expensive and many people did not know
how to read.
</p>

<p>
In the sixteenth century, there were in existence
several translations or versions of some of the
books of the Bible; and there was a great desire
on the part of English people to be able to read
the whole Bible in English so that everyone might
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P54"></a>54}</span>
understand it.  Comparatively few people could
read Latin, and the translations in English were
of some of the books only.
</p>

<p>
The authorized English translation of the Bible
was first published in 1611.  It was the work of
some forty-seven scholars who had taken all the
different versions then in use and had translated
and compiled the various readings into one book.
You will recognize that 1611 is a date belonging
to the time when English literature was in one of
its most glorious periods.  The authorized English
translation of the Bible is written in very
perfect English.  It is what we call a masterpiece.
The beautiful diction of the authorized
version helps us to remember the stories of the
Bible, and the great passages in which we find
our highest spiritual life.
</p>

<p>
A list of some of the wonderful passages in the
Bible, especially such passages as were written to
tell of the life of Christ and to record His sayings,
is given at the end of this chapter.  You will find
the Ten Commandments, which many of you know
by heart, in Exodus, chap. xix, 1-24, chap. xx, 1-2.
Solomon's great prayer at the dedication of the
Temple is in I Kings, chap. viii, 22-58.  The Book
of Psalms is read by countless numbers of people
all through their lives.  Some of the Psalms you
will specially want to read are i, xv, xix, xxiii, xxiv,
xxvii, xlvi, lxvii, c, ciii, cvii, cxxi, cxxvi, cxxvii,
cxxxiv, cxlv, cxlviii, and cl.  Many great passages
are to be found in the books of the Prophets,
and in Job.  Read Isaiah, chapters xxxv, xl
and lv which belong to the greatest writings in
the world.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P55"></a>55}</span>
</p>

<p>
But the most important parts of the Bible for
us to read, the easiest to read, the most simple and
beautiful, are these which tell of the life of Christ.

CHAPTER X
<br><br>
DUMAS&mdash;HUGO&mdash;STEVENSON
</h3>

<p>
A story can scarcely open better than by
showing us a young man setting out to
find his fortune.  One of the most eminent
of romantic writers, Alexandre Dumas, begins
<i>The Three Musketeers</i> after this fashion.  We
have a choice of reading the story either in
French or English.  Dumas, a Frenchman, wrote
<i>Les Trois Mousquetaires</i> in French, and, therefore,
naturally, this thrilling story is more wonderful
in French even than it is in English.  But an
English translation, one can promise every boy
and girl, is very well worth reading.
</p>

<p>
On an April morning of the year 1626, in the
market town of Meung, in the country of France,
a young man, eighteen years of age, came to the
door of an inn.  He was riding an orange-coloured
pony, none too good a specimen of a steed.  His
name was d'Artagnan.  He came from Gascony,
and in a story it is always taken for granted that
Gascons are very proud and hot-tempered.  He
was poor and somewhat shabby in appearance.
A man at one of the windows of the inn appeared
to be laughing at him and at the queer colour of
his pony; indeed the man had called the pony a
buttercup.  D'Artagnan, who was wearing a
sword, at once challenged the man, Rochefort,
to fight with him.  There was a fight which was
rather a scuffle than a combat.  Still d'Artagnan
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P60"></a>60}</span>
acquitted himself with credit, although later
he was beaten into insensibility by Rochefort's
servants.  He lost, however, the precious letter
his father had given him to M. de Treville,
Captain of the King's Musketeers.  Nevertheless,
that same day he rode to the St. Antoine Gate of
Paris, sold his horse, and on the day following
presented himself in the antechamber of M. de
Treville.
</p>

<p>
There he meets the three famous musketeers,
Athos, Aramis and Porthos.  Louis XIII is King
of France, Anne of Austria is Queen, and
Cardinal Richelieu is as powerful a leader as
either of them.  So begins the thrilling series of
romances in which d'Artagnan appears, the whole
series being the masterpiece of Alexandre Dumas.
</p>

<p>
<i>The Three Musketeers</i> is the first story about
d'Artagnan.  The second is called <i>Twenty Years
After</i>; the third, <i>Vicomte de Bragelonne</i>.  In the
second story, Louis XIII has died and Anne of
Austria is regent.  Her chief minister is Mazarin.
We see in his youth the young king who is to be
the famous Louis XIV.  But the really important
characters are d'Artagnan, Athos, Aramis and
Porthos; the Vicomte de Bragelonne, who is
dearly loved by these four heroes, is Athos' son.
</p>

<p>
French history is shown by Dumas to have a
curious relation to English history.  But the
connection is more or less imaginary.  When we read
these stories, it is possible that we may obtain
some idea of French history, even of English
history.  We see brilliant scenes of colour,
romance and intrigue.  We read of triumphs,
catastrophes and great occasions.  But what really
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P61"></a>61}</span>
matters are d'Artagnan's splendid wit and
audacity, the silent dignity of Athos, the subtlety
of Aramis, and the marvellous strength of
Porthos.
</p>

<p>
These four form a heroic comradeship.  They
help, support, rescue and defend each other.
Danger follows danger.  Intrigue leads to
intrigue.  D'Artagnan never fails in strategy, nor
Athos in nobility.  When any one of the four is
sorely pressed, the others are certain to appear
before the danger becomes overwhelming.  There
are many famous episodes in these stories, the
recovery by d'Artagnan and his man Planchet of the
Queen's diamond studs, the release from prison of
the Duc de Beaufort by means of a colossal pie
in which are concealed ropes and daggers, the
kidnapping of General Monk by d'Artagnan and his
followers disguised as fishermen, the epic of the
death of Porthos, who is one of the strongest
heroes to be found in any romance.
</p>

<p>
When we read such stories as these written by
Dumas we are made to feel light-hearted.  He is
gay and witty, while under wit and gayety he
hides a tender heart.  The man who wrote the
stories is himself frank, kind and generous, and
we discover the same frankness, kindness and
generosity in the pages of his romances.  His
writing is characterized by speed, directness and
clearness.  It has been said, and no doubt truly,
that sometimes a person suffering from homesickness
has been so invigorated mentally by reading
one of Dumas' stories that the fit of homesickness
has been cured.
</p>

<p>
Dumas was something of a giant physically,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P62"></a>62}</span>
like Porthos.  Indeed, it is thought that he may
have made Porthos a partial portrait of himself
and of his father, who also was a large man and
very powerful.  Dumas' grandfather, a Frenchman,
had left France for St. Domingo and there
had married a native of the island, a coloured
woman.  Dumas inherited the physical characteristics
of his father who was like his St. Domingan
mother.  The vivacity and gaiety we find in
the works of Dumas may have come in part at
least from his grandmother.  His mother was left
a widow early and she and her children lived in
great poverty.  Dumas' immense vitality and high
spirits conquered many obstacles.  We enjoy
reading about d'Artagnan, Athos, Aramis and
Porthos all the more for knowing that the writer
who invented them and wrote of them so gayly,
was a brave man.
</p>

<p>
Romance carries us easily from one country to
another.  Yet a second noted writer of romance,
in some ways more gifted than Dumas, is also a
Frenchman, Victor Hugo, generally considered
greater as a poet than as a writer of prose.  Two
of his books, <i>Notre Dame de Paris</i>, and <i>Les
Misérables</i>, belong to the famous books of the
world and may be read in the French original,
preferably of course, or in an English translation.
</p>

<p>
Hugo's romances, as well as the romantic stories
of Dumas, were inspired to a certain extent by the
novels of Sir Walter Scott.  But in Scott we find
ourselves in the sunlight of a reasonable and
happy world.  The atmosphere of Hugo's stories
one might compare to that of stormy days,
illuminated by flashes of lightning.  The romance of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P63"></a>63}</span>
<i>Notre Dame de Paris</i> is dominated by a vision of
the cathedral in Paris which seems in the story far
greater and larger than it is actually.  Some day
you may see the cathedral for yourselves, but
before doing so, read Hugo's story.  It imparts
to the famous cathedral an air of wonder and
mystery which proves to us Hugo's remarkable
powers as a writer.  Round Notre Dame he
gathers as strange a multitude of people as can be
found in any story, the beautiful gypsy dancer
Esmeralda, her goat Djali, the terrible dwarf
Quasimodo, the swarm of beggars, with their
beggar king, Claude Frollo, Captain Phoebus,
Pierre Gringoire, and the unhappy recluse Gudule.
</p>

<p>
An even more remarkable romance by Victor
Hugo is named <i>Les Misérables</i>.  The book is more
than a story.  Hugo brings in so many affairs
outside the story itself that when we have finished
the book we feel as if we had read part of the
history of the world.  You remember the strong
impulse to heal and relieve the distresses of
humanity which we found in the novels of Charles
Dickens.  The same powerful motive is seen in
action in these romances by Victor Hugo.  Perhaps
there are few books in which we can find
explained so clearly the problems, distresses and
poverty of the older and more crowded countries
of the continent of Europe as they existed at the
time of the story.  Hugo means to awaken our
pity and he does so.  Jean Valjean, the escaped
convict of <i>Les Misérables</i>, is condemned by harsh
and wicked laws, yet he becomes the soul of
tenderness and goodness.  For his sake, and for
the sake of the good Bishop Myriel who first
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P64"></a>64}</span>
showed Jean Valjean what love and forgiveness
mean, we should read some part at least of <i>Les
Misérables</i>; or we may be able to find someone who
has read Hugo's immensely long novel and is
willing to tell us the story of Jean Valjean.
</p>

<p>
It is difficult to imagine a sharper contrast to the
writings of Victor Hugo than the gay, youthful,
carefree stories which Robert Louis Stevenson
wrote for young people.  Yet Stevenson admired
Hugo greatly, and was as well one of the most
loyal adherents of Dumas.  Stevenson wrote
<i>Treasure Island</i> to help his step-son, Lloyd
Osbourne, then a boy of twelve years old, through
rather a dull and lonely holiday spent near
Braemar in the north of Scotland.  Stevenson's
father, an old man with a boy's heart, used to listen
to the story when it was read aloud in the
afternoons as soon as each chapter was written, one
chapter a day.  It was Thomas Stevenson, the
father, who wrote out the list of the contents of
Billy Bones' sea chest.
</p>

<p>
Robert Louis Stevenson loved adventure, and
this is one of the reasons why <i>Treasure Island</i>
is such a delightful story.  First, he and Lloyd
Osbourne drew the map that you will find at the
beginning of <i>Treasure Island</i>.  Then the story
begins, told by Jim Hawkins, whose mother kept
an inn, the Admiral Benbow.  To the inn comes
Billy Bones, bringing his sea chest.  Later one
old sailor after another arrives, the most terrifying
of all being the blind man Pew, who felt his
way tapping with a stick.  Soon it appears there
is hidden treasure to be found.  Jim Hawkins,
Dr. Livesay and Squire Trelawney sail away on the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P65"></a>65}</span>
<i>Hispaniola</i>, but many of the crew on board, led
by John Silver, mean to take the treasure for
themselves.
</p>

<p>
<i>Treasure Island</i> is one of the best stories of
adventure ever written for young people.  What
happens on board the <i>Hispaniola</i> and at the island
is waiting hidden in the pages of the story for you
to read.
</p>

<p>
Robert Louis Stevenson was born in the city of
Edinburgh, which was also Sir Walter Scott's
native city.  He was a brave, very lovable person.
All his life, he was more or less of an invalid.
But he did not allow ill-health to make much
difference to his way of living.  He kept on working,
and as you know, his work was writing.  There is
nothing about his books which would make any
one think he was an invalid.  Finally, he and his
wife went to live at Samoa in the South Seas,
where the climate suited him, and he was able to
lead a more active life than had been possible for
some time.  He was engaged in writing what is
judged to be his best work, a novel called <i>Weir
of Hermiston</i>, when he died.  Of the many books
that Stevenson wrote, two others besides <i>Treasure Island</i>
are especially interesting to boys and
girls, <i>Kidnapped</i>, and its continuation <i>Catriona</i>.
Together, the two stories make one volume, called
<i>David Balfour</i> after the hero.
</p>

<p>
Swiftly moving, gay, gallant, easy to read, sweet
and sound at heart as the kernel of a nut, Robert
Louis Stevenson's romantic adventurous stories
belong more completely than most books of fiction
to the world of youth.  He wrote <i>A Child's
Garden of Verse</i>, <i>Underwoods</i>, and <i>Ballads</i>, as
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P66"></a>66}</span>
well as other novels, <i>Prince Otto</i>, <i>Dr. Jekyll
and Mr. Hyde</i>, and <i>The Master of Ballantrae</i>.
Stevenson's essays are much thought of; and he
was an individual and delightful letter-writer.

<p>
Let us stop for a little while to consider why
we enjoy ourselves so much when we read
stories of romance and adventure.  Indeed,
books of this character are fascinating to almost
everyone.
</p>

<p>
You have read of the magic carpet which belongs
to the world of fairy tales.  One had only to
stand on the carpet and wish one's self in any part
of the world, to travel where one wanted to be in
a flash.  Many of us would like to travel to strange
countries, learn foreign customs, see uncommon
sights and listen to marvels of which we have
not known before.  Stories of romance and
adventure enable us to visit, as it were, all parts of
the known world; we can even imagine ourselves
in unknown worlds by means of their assistance.
So, in a real sense it is true that the magic of a
good book of adventure is like that of the carpet in
the story; it can carry us anywhere.
</p>

<p>
But perhaps the most enjoyable quality we find
in such books is the power they have to give us a
sense of holiday.  We turn to the first page of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P68"></a>68}</span>
whatever book of adventure we may happen to
choose, and then in a moment we are away with
the hero, travelling swiftly by sea or land,
wandering on foot, fighting battles, in peril from
robbers, helping the distressed, finding treasure,
climbing mountains, or lost in the desert.  We are
exactly the kind of people we want to be and we
have a share in all kinds of wonderful happenings.
</p>

<p>
The adventures in these books may not always
seem probable, or, as people say, true to life.  But
this makes very little difference fortunately in
romantic and adventurous stories which have a
splendid truth of their own.  The truth belonging
to these stories is that the bravery, strength,
resourcefulness, generosity, honour and chivalry of
which we read are among the finest qualities in the
world; these qualities, with patience and
persistence added, can actually sometimes achieve the
seemingly impossible happenings related to us.
</p>

<p>
A moment ago, we spoke of being lost in the
desert.  You very probably know that a book
called <i>Robinson Crusoe</i> is the most famous story
ever written about being cast away on an
uninhabited island.  Indeed, ever since Daniel Defoe
wrote the story everyone who likes speculating
what he would do if this or that happened, has
tried to imagine what it would be like to live alone
by oneself.  We can make a game of writing down
what we think we really could not do without under
such circumstances.  But Daniel Defoe, basing his
story partly on the actual experiences of a man
called Alexander Selkirk, has played this game
better than anyone else is ever likely to play it.
<i>Robinson Crusoe</i> is a wonderful story, so vivid,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P69"></a>69}</span>
convincing and reasonable, that it might be the
actual journal of a man, a very practical and
clever man cast wholly on his own resources, with
the never failing bounties of nature on which he
may draw.
</p>

<p>
Robinson Crusoe had been many years on the
island before he found one day, marked on the
sand, the print of a naked foot.  Imagine how he
must have looked at it!  Of course he knew that
it had been made by a savage, and so it was.
Eventually, he is visited by these savages.  He
rescues one of them; and because Friday was the
day of the week on which the man was rescued,
Robinson Crusoe called him Friday.  He was a
gentle, kind, good fellow who served Robinson
Crusoe faithfully all the rest of his life.  It was
thirty-five years before Robinson Crusoe was able
to return to England; eventually a ship came to
the island.  There is a second part of the story
which relates further adventures.  One of the best
parts of the narrative is its peaceful ending which
tells us that at last the hero found happiness and
contentment after all his wanderings.
</p>

<p>
It is interesting to know some of the facts
concerning the people who have written the books we
are reading.  Daniel Defoe wrote this great story
of adventure when he was fifty-eight or fifty-nine
years old.  He had had a stirring and difficult life,
had taken part in Monmouth's rebellion, had been
in prison, and had been put in the pillory, which
was an old form of punishment now properly
abolished.  He was a journalist and novelist, and
wrote a great deal, especially in the form of
pamphlets.  His story, <i>Robinson Crusoe</i>, was first
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P70"></a>70}</span>
published as long ago as 1719.  Its popularity has
never failed since then.
</p>

<p>
Now let us suppose that we are looking at a shelf
which holds ten books, counting <i>Robinson Crusoe</i>
as the first; all the ten are exceptionally good
stories of adventure.  What are the other nine
books about and who wrote them?
</p>

<p>
Following <i>Robinson Crusoe</i> comes a tale of
robbers, called <i>Lorna Doone</i>, which is a story of
a boy named Jan, or John, Ridd, and of a famous
outlaw family, the Doones, who lived in a beautiful,
wild glen of Exmoor, part of the romantic
English county of Devon.  Richard Doddridge
Blackmore, the author, knew Exmoor and Devon
well.  He had been a schoolmaster and had studied
law before he became a novelist.  The date of the
story belongs to the time of James II.  Blackmore
draws a wonderful picture of the English country
at that time, remote, strong, romantic and
stout-hearted.  <i>Lorna Doone</i> is one of the most lovable
romances ever written.
</p>

<p>
Jan's father was killed by the Doones when
Jan was a lad.  He had to leave school and come
home to take care of his mother and sister, and
learn how to be the master of a farm.  Blackmore
was skilled in all country knowledge, and he writes
truly and attractively of farm life.  When Jan
was a small boy he saw Lorna, an orphan and a
lovely child, who was of the same kindred as the
Doones but not like them in heart or disposition.
Jan Ridd grows up a giant.  He is a great fighter,
and brave, clean and generous, a hero of the
people.  We love to read of Dunkery Beacon, of the
great snow storm, of Jan's long contest with the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P71"></a>71}</span>
wicked Doones, of Tom Faggis, the highwayman,
and his mare Winnie, of Jan's mother and sister,
of the lovely Lorna who is brought by Jan at last
home to the farm, and finally of Jan's great fight
with Carver Doone.

Next are two fine historical romances by Charles
Kingsley, who was rector of Eversley in
Hampshire, England, for many years.  Kingsley, a
vigorous, wholehearted man whose writing is of
the same character, was the author of a number
of well-known books.  He was specially interested
in history and was professor of modern history
at Cambridge in his later years.  <i>Hereward the
Wake</i> is a story of the Old English.  Wake means
watchful.  What happy, thrilling hours boys and
girls and other people have spent with Hereward.
No one who reads this story can forget it.
<i>Westward Ho!</i> is a story of the sea.  The name of its
hero is Amyas Leigh.  He sails away with
adventuring ships to the Western world, but
returns to command a ship in the Armada.
</p>

<p>
Jules Verne was a Frenchman who wrote stories
of scientific imagination.  His <i>Twenty Thousand
Leagues Under the Sea</i> was written long before
the days of submarines, but in it you will find an
exciting account of what it is like to live in the
depths of the sea.  Jules Verne's stories have
helped to inspire many inventors; this in itself is
a proud achievement.  We may think that <i>Round
the World in Eighty Days</i> is slow travelling
compared with the speed of to-day.  But when we
read the story, we will find ourselves living in an
atmosphere of haste, despatch and adventure in
travel which no writer has yet been able to
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P72"></a>72}</span>
surpass.  Many a lad afterwards famous has spent
long hours with Jules Verne.
</p>

<p>
The famous Captain Marryat has taught us
more, probably, about the sea, the navy and
fighting ships than any other writer of stories of
adventure.  Frederick Marryat was born in
England of Huguenot ancestry in the year 1792.  He
belonged to a family of fifteen children and seems
always to have been of a stirring, restless
disposition.  More than once, he ran away from home
or school to go to sea, giving as an excuse that he
had to wear his elder brother's old clothes.  He
was not a particularly attentive student, although
a story is told that he was once discovered standing
on his head, in order, he explained, to see if
he could learn one of his lessons better in that
position.  He had tried, so he said, for three
hours to learn the lesson in the more usual
attitude.  This of course was one of young Frederick
Marryat's little jokes.  He entered the King's
Navy in 1806 as a midshipman when he was
fourteen years old.  It was his good fortune to be
under a very fine type of Captain, Lord Cochrane,
the Earl of Dundonald, an able, fearless and
upright person.  In many of Marryat's stories, we
find that his captains are like the Earl of
Dundonald.  Marryat's promotion in the Navy was
rapid.  These were the years of the great
Napoleonic Wars.  He had reached the rank of
Commander by the end of the war in 1815 when
he was only twenty-three, having seen much smart
service.  Later, he was given the responsible task
of mounting guard over Napoleon.
</p>

<p>
Two of Marryat's best known and most interesting
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P73"></a>73}</span>
stories are <i>Midshipman Easy</i> and <i>Peter
Simple</i>.  These give interesting, authentic, and
exciting accounts of life at sea from the point of
view first of a midshipman, and then of a young
officer in command.  Farce, fun, reality and
strange adventure are so blended that we can
almost imagine we hear the splash of waves, smell
the salt tang of the sea, and experience the
nerve-racking excitement of going into action.  There is
occasionally a quality of coarseness in Marryat's
stories, but they are honest, straightforward and
brave.  We learn from them with unmistakable
clearness that the world is not a place where
people are pampered and made much of, but a scene
of discipline and hard work, as well as of fun and
adventure.
</p>

<p>
<i>Two Years Before the Mast</i>, by Richard Henry
Dana, is a narrative of the American merchant
service, as well known in its way as Captain
Marryat's stories of the Navy.  Young Dana was
at Harvard University when, on account of his
eyesight, he became unable to study.  He had had
a wish to be a sailor previously, but his father had
not approved.  Young Dana felt now that a long
voyage would re-establish his health.  He shipped
as a sailor before the mast, and sailed from the
port of Boston in the year 1834 on the brig
<i>Pilgrim</i>.  He returned two years later in the <i>Alert</i>,
having kept a full and careful log of his voyages.
Re-entering Harvard University he found time
during his studies to prepare the manuscript of
his book which was published in New York, 1840.
The year following, an English edition appeared,
and was bought up by the naval authorities for
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P74"></a>74}</span>
distribution on the Queen's ships.  <i>Before the
Mast</i> is a plain, simple narrative of the daily life
of a sailor on a merchant ship.  It tells of many
hardships, some of which have been remedied
since the publication of the book.  It has been
called "A voice from the forecastle".  Dana's
accounts of rounding Cape Horn are wonderfully
vivid, and all the descriptions of California in its
early days are enthralling.  <i>Before the Mast</i> is a
remarkably interesting and realistic narrative; it
is, however, a book of travel rather than a story
of adventure.  The incidents are plainly in no case
imaginary.
</p>

<p>
A book about Canada of a wholly different
character is a well-known historical romance, <i>The
Golden Dog</i>, written by William Kirby.  This is a
tale of early days in the beautiful, romantic city of
Quebec when some of the colour and glory of the
French court was reproduced on western soil.
<i>The Golden Dog</i> has not a little romantic charm.
Many readers have been puzzled and attracted by
the rhyme which in all likelihood first gave Kirby
the idea for his story.
</p>

<p class="poem">
  I am a dog that gnaws his bone,<br>
  I couch and gnaw it all alone&mdash;<br>
  A time will come, which is not yet,<br>
  When I'll bite him by whom I'm bit.<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
The lines have been translated from the French.
Here are the words of the original.
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Je suis un chien qui ronge l'os,<br>
  En le rongeant je prends mon repos.<br>
  Un temps viendra qui n'est pas venu<br>
  Que je mordrai qui m' aura mordu.<br>
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P75"></a>75}</span>

on a building in Quebec City.

HARKER&mdash;THE LIVING FOREST
</h3>

<p>
We occasionally meet an odd person,
someone out of the common, who is not like
other people.  Books can be odd too, not
like other books, but strikingly individual, and
interesting for the very reason that they are odd.
<i>Lavengro</i>, written by a man with out-of-the-way
knowledge of many things, whose name was
George Borrow, is a book of this description.
</p>

<p>
Possibly not everyone who tries to read
<i>Lavengro</i> will care for it very much.  As people
say, it is not a book that belongs to everybody.
Yet <i>Lavengro</i> is a great book, or at least a
remarkable one, and numbers of people find much
enjoyment in it.  What those who read <i>Lavengro</i>
value in it most is a sense which it possesses of
life under the open sky.  In <i>Lavengro</i> we have as
our companions the winds and the stars.  Its
characters have no fixed place of abode, but are
always ready to travel on the high road which
winds away into the distance inviting us to follow
it.  There is something in almost all of us which
answers to the call of the open sky and the
winding road.  Even if we have no intention of
living that kind of life, a gypsy's life, we like to
read about it.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P77"></a>77}</span>
</p>

<p>
<i>Lavengro</i> is a book about the gypsies.  The
word Lavengro is romany, or gypsy, and it means
word-master.  George Borrow had the gift of
learning languages easily and knew many
different languages.  The gypsies therefore called
him <i>Lavengro</i>.
</p>

<p>
There is a famous passage in the book, which
you will find at the very end of chapter twenty-five,
that gathers up the charm of the narrative,
or story, in a few words.  Here it is:
</p>

<p>
"Life is sweet, brother."
</p>

<p>
"Do you think so?"
</p>

<p>
"Think so!&mdash;There's night and day, brother,
both sweet things; sun, moon, and stars, brother,
all sweet things; there's likewise a wind on the
heath.  Life is very sweet, brother; who would
wish to die?"
</p>

<p>
"I would wish to die&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"You talk like a gorgio&mdash;which is the same as
talking like a fool&mdash;were you a Romany Chal
you would talk wiser.  Wish to die, indeed!&mdash;A
Romany Chal would wish to live for ever!"
</p>

<p>
"In sickness, Jasper?"
</p>

<p>
"There's the sun and the stars, brother."
</p>

<p>
"In blindness, Jasper?"
</p>

<p>
"There's the wind on the heath, brother; if I
could only feel that, I would gladly live forever.
Dosta, we'll now go to the tents and put on the
gloves; and I'll try to make you feel what a sweet
thing it is to be alive, brother!"
</p>

<p>
Jasper Petulengro, the chief of the Smith tribe
of gypsies, and Lavengro, who are the two men
speaking, were skilled boxers and liked to box
with each other.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P78"></a>78}</span>
</p>

<p>
Notice how sharply we can distinguish the
difference between the points of view of the two men.
Lavengro, or Borrow, wants in the future something
better and more perfect than he has in his
present life, but Jasper loves everything as it is,
and wants to live the same kind of life always.
There is truth in both points of view.  We all
long for perfection.  But, certainly, Jasper is
right when he sees and feels the deep, intense
beauty and ecstasy which live in nature and which
we feel in the wind on the heath, the sky, the stars,
the sun and the moon.
</p>

<p>
This brief quotation will give you an idea of
Borrow's story at its best.  Even if you have read
no more than the ending of chapter twenty-five,
you will know something of <i>Lavengro</i>, which is a
book of adventure, and yet has a very distinct
character of its own.
</p>

<p>
<i>The Last of the Mohicans</i>, by James Fenimore
Cooper, is judged to be one of the most successful
and enjoyable stories ever written about North
American Indians.  You know how we can form
in our minds a picture of the great skill of the
Indian as a hunter.  We can imagine an Indian
hunter stealing through the woods, treading so
lightly and carefully that he makes no noise,
bending his head to listen, able to hear sounds that to
the rest of us are inaudible, his quick eyes noting
tiny signs of broken twigs or crushed grass which
are to us invisible.  This picture, which, if we
could look into other people's minds, we would
find hidden away in the thoughts of almost
everyone, the world owes largely to the author of <i>The
Last of the Mohicans</i>.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P79"></a>79}</span>
</p>

<p>
Cooper was born in the State of New Jersey
in 1789, but, while he was still an infant, he was
taken to the State of New York.  His father had
bought a large tract of land there, and in the wild
forest and on the shores of Otsego Lake, young
James Cooper learned to watch and know the
Indians.  He was sent to college, but was not very
successful as a student, and before long shipped
as a sailor before the mast.  For a number of
years, he had many experiences on the Great
Lakes and at sea.  Finally, he gave up being a
sailor, and lived near Cooperstown.  <i>The Last of
the Mohicans</i> is one of a series of five stories
known as the Leatherstocking Tales.  Cooper
wrote many stories, but this series is the most
interesting.  Leatherstocking himself is the white
man who has gained Indian skill and cunning as a
hunter.  He is known by many names,
Leatherstocking, Natty Bumppo, Hawk-eye, and La
Longue Carabine.  Part of the enjoyment we have
in reading Cooper's stories arises from the
circumstance that these stirring and exciting days
of which he writes have already almost completely
vanished and his books contain a record which is
of value historically.  Read the following
description of the scout Leatherstocking.
</p>

<p>
"His person, though muscular, was rather
attenuated than full; but every nerve and muscle
appeared strong and indurated by unremitting
exposure and toil.  He wore a hunting-shirt of
forest-green, fringed with faded yellow, and a
summer cap of skins, which had been shorn of
their fur.  He also bore a knife in a girdle of
wampum, like that which confined the scanty
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P80"></a>80}</span>
garments of the Indian, but no tomahawk.  His
moccasins were ornamented after the gay fashion
of the natives, while the only part of his under
dress which appeared below the hunting-frock,
was a pair of buckskin leggings, that laced at the
sides, and were gartered above the knees with the
sinews of a deer.  A pouch and horn completed
his personal accoutrements, though a rifle of a
great length, which the theory of the more
ingenious whites had taught them was the most
dangerous of all fire-arms, leaned against a
neighbouring sapling."
</p>

<p>
There is something honest, strong and dependable
about Hawk-eye, besides his bravery and
skill, which makes us like and respect him greatly.
But the most heroic and romantic figure in the
book is young Uncas, who is the last of the
Mohicans.  This story of danger, attack, slaughter
and peril, centering round Hawk-eye, Uncas, his
father Chingachgook, and two beautiful English
girls attempting to escape through the woods with
a young English officer, Heyward, is almost the
perfection of a story of adventure in its own
class.  As an example of how thrilling the story
can be, read the account of the shooting contest in
chapter twenty-nine.
</p>

<p>
Several generations of boys and girls have
already enjoyed <i>Tom Sawyer</i> and <i>Huckleberry
Finn</i>.  Perhaps no other writer has ever
succeeded as well as Mark Twain in putting a real
boy between the covers of a book in a story.  Tom
Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn are not fanciful
portraits.  They are exactly such boys as anyone
to-day can watch playing in a vacant lot, or down
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P81"></a>81}</span>
by a river on a raft, or up in a hay-mow, or
playing at being robbers in an old deserted shed or
house, or reading books, or telling stories, or
teasing but loving mothers and aunties, and learning
about grown-up men and life in general.  <i>Tom
Sawyer</i> is the first of Mark Twain's famous books
about boys, and <i>Huckleberry Finn</i> is a continuation
of the same story.
</p>

<p>
Tom lived with his Aunt Polly in the village
of St. Petersburg on the Mississippi.  He was
the leading spirit among the boys of the place,
largely because he had an active imagination and
could devise many exciting games which often led
to real adventures.  Huckleberry Finn was a boy
without a home; he had a father who was a source
of danger rather than a loving protector.  In
<i>Huckleberry Finn</i>, there is the splendid story of
Jim who was a slave and ran away with Huckleberry.
As we read of their adventures, while they
floated down the Mississippi on a raft, we learn to
know and love Jim for his devotion, loyalty and
child-like nature.  Huck, too, plays as fine a part
as many a hero who may appear more romantic
than this runaway boy.  But you must read
<i>Huckleberry Finn</i> yourself, and find out what happened.
The great Mississippi river, mysterious, picturesque,
flowing always past their village into the
unknown south, exercised a powerful fascination on
the minds of the boys.  Many of their adventures
had to do with the river, and some of the happenings
were terrifying as well as exciting.  But Tom
and Huck actually did find hidden treasure and
each boy's share was put in the bank, so that the
boys had a small yearly income at the end of the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P82"></a>82}</span>
first story.  These two books, when we read them,
give us a curious, lasting feeling of real life and
actual happenings, probably in part because
Mark Twain, whose everyday name was Samuel
Clemens, must have been writing about his own
boyhood.  When he was a boy, nothing would
satisfy him but learning to be a pilot on a
Mississippi steamboat; he was on the river for four
years.
</p>

<p>
There are many other romantic and adventurous
stories for us to read.  Make sure that the author
knows and understands what he is writing about,
otherwise it is seldom worth while to spend much
time in reading his book.  Stories of romance and
adventure ought always to be brave and fearless,
kind and generous, pure and light-hearted.  They
ought to make us feel that it is worth while to go
on an adventure.  When these things are true of
a book, we can spend many happy hours with its
hero, no matter where he rides, or sails, or flies.
</p>

<p>
There are three books, the work of authors who
belong to our own time, that we should not miss
reading.  First comes Rudyard Kipling's glorious
story of a boy in India called <i>Kim</i>; then the poet
Masefield's story of <i>Sard Harker</i> and of the sea
and South America; and, last of the three, a fine
story of the woods and rivers of the far north,
called <i>The Living Forest</i>, written by a Canadian
artist, Arthur Heming.

CHAPTER XIII
<br><br>
THE ILIAD AND THE ODYSSEY&mdash;GREEK
HEROES&mdash;TANGLEWOOD TALES&mdash;THE WONDER BOOK
</h3>

<p>
Once upon a time, nearly three thousand
years ago, a poet in a song which he sang
of heroes described the making of a suit of
armour.
</p>

<p>
The poet's name was Homer.  His poem is
called <i>The Iliad</i>.  Some day possibly you will read
for yourselves <i>The Iliad</i> in the original Greek, for
Homer was a Greek.  There are many good
translations, both in poetry and prose.  The beautiful
translation known as <i>The Iliad of Homer</i>, done
into English prose by Andrew Lang, Walter Leaf
and Ernest Myers, is one of the best translations
for our present purpose.
</p>

<p>
In Homer's day people believed in the existence
of many gods, some more important and others of
less consequence.  These gods, both men and
women, imagined by the Greeks, were like human
beings, only more powerful and more beautiful.
But they were not any better than ordinary men
and women.  Indeed, the gods of the Greeks were
often bad-tempered, jealous, cruel, and faithless.
The Greeks imagined that their gods had
favourites among men and women.  When a battle was
raging, the gods were supposed to help one side
or the other; and in <i>The Iliad</i> you may read how
Aphrodite helped her favourite, Paris, how
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P86"></a>86}</span>
Poseidon was on the side of the Achaians, and
Apollo aided Hector.  The most powerful and
important gods, of whom the greatest was Zeus, lived
on Mount Olympus.  But the Greeks believed that
the sea, rivers, streams, springs, hillsides, and
trees, were the dwelling-places of various deities
or gods.
</p>

<p>
<i>The Iliad</i> is an epic of the Trojan War which
was fought between the Greeks and the Trojans.
The famous hero Achilles, who had quarrelled
with King Agamemnon, would not go to fight
himself, but he lent his armour to his noble friend
Patroklos, who drove the Trojans from the ships,
but was himself slain by Hector, son of King
Priam of Troy.  Achilles was then without
armour, and Thetis, a goddess, said by the Greeks
to be the mother of Achilles, went on his behalf to
a very clever god, named Hephaistos, who was
lame, but had wonderful skill in making armour.
Hephaistos, if he had lived now, would likely have
been a great engineer.
</p>

<p>
In the eighteenth book of <i>The Iliad</i>, we can read
a description of Hephaistos, of some of the
marvels he had made and of his meeting with
Thetis.
</p>

<p>
Hephaistos "from the anvil rose limping, a
huge bulk, but under him his slender legs moved
nimbly.  The bellows he set away from the fire,
and gathered all his gear wherewith he worked
into a silver chest; and with a sponge he wiped
his face and hands and sturdy neck and shaggy
breast, and did on his doublet, and took a stout
staff and went forth limping; but there were
handmaidens of gold that moved to help their
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P87"></a>87}</span>
lord, the semblances of living maids.  In them is
understanding at their hearts, in them are voice
and strength, and they have skill of the immortal
gods.  These moved beneath their lord, and he
gat him haltingly near to where Thetis was, and
set him on a bright seat, and clasped her hand in
his and spake and called her by her name."
</p>

<p>
It is delightful to understand while we read that
the Greeks three thousand years ago were already
imagining the marvels which could be
accomplished by mankind.  Many of these marvels
actually have been achieved since then, only not
exactly in the shape that the Greeks imagined.
</p>

<p>
Hephaistos made, for Thetis to give to Achilles,
a shield and a corslet and a helmet and greaves.
He made them strong and beautiful.  On the shield
he fashioned wondrous pictures of life among the
Greeks, marriage feasts, dancing, law courts, a
city besieged, armies fighting, herds of cattle,
harvesting, feasting, a vineyard, and youths and
maidens gathering grapes.  If you turn to this
eighteenth book of Homer's <i>Iliad</i>, you may spend
a very happy hour reading of Hephaistos and the
armour.
</p>

<p>
These songs made by Homer are one of the
glories of mankind.  In everything he sang, there
is the special genius of the ancient Greeks, a power
to create beauty, so perfect in all its proportions
that it gives people when they read his songs a
feeling of strength and steadiness as well as joy.
Yet, it is true at the same time, that parts of <i>The
Iliad</i> and <i>The Odyssey</i> show us a world which was
savage and barbarous.
</p>

<p>
In <i>The Odyssey</i>, Homer tells of the wanderings
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P88"></a>88}</span>
of Odysseus, King of Ithaca, on his way back from
the Trojan war to his own island on the west
coast of Greece.  His adventures are as wonderful
as any that have ever been related in song or
story.  The description of his home-coming, to his
wife Penelope and his son Telemachus, is one of
the stories rightly called universal, for such
stories belong to everyone.  A charming part of
<i>The Odyssey</i> contains the story of Odysseus in his
wanderings coming to Scheria where King
Alcinous reigns.  Nausicaa, the King's daughter,
with her maidens, had gone out in the early
morning to wash the clothes of her father, mother and
brethren, and after their labour, the princess and
her companions were playing a game of ball when
their cries of excitement woke the weary
Odysseus from his slumbers.  You will find this
adventure of Odysseus in the sixth book of <i>The
Odyssey</i>, of which there is a prose translation by
S. H. Butcher and Andrew Lang.
</p>

<p>
There are many other stories of the early
Greeks.  Some of them have been re-told in three
books, written for young people.  In <i>The Heroes</i>
by Charles Kingsley you may read of Perseus,
the Argonauts and Theseus.  <i>Tanglewood Tales</i>
and <i>The Wonder Book</i> were written by Nathaniel
Hawthorne for his children.  One of the best of
the stories in <i>The Wonder Book</i> is called The
Miraculous Pitcher, a tale of two old people,
Philemon and his wife Baucis, and of what happened
to them.  These stories are not exactly
fairy-tales, because people believed in that far away
time that the gods visited them and played pranks
like boys and girls.

These three books, <i>The Heroes</i>, <i>Tanglewood
Tales</i> and <i>The Wonder Book</i> are easy to read and
interesting.  Yet, after a while, although perhaps
not for some years, you likely will find that you
would rather turn to a translation of <i>The Iliad</i> or
<i>The Odyssey</i>, so that you may read for yourself
Homer's songs telling of the world long ago in
its youth, and of these great heroes.

CHAPTER XIV
<br><br>
ÆSOP'S FABLES&mdash;GRIMM's FAIRY TALES&mdash;HANS
ANDERSEN'S FAIRY TALES&mdash;THE ARABIAN
NIGHTS&mdash;MALORY'S MORTE D'ARTHUR
</h3>

<p>
We know a little of the glorious gift of song
that the early Greeks themselves enjoyed
and left to coming generations of mankind.
But other countries, these countries where
men and women earliest taught themselves by
hard work, as we say, to be civilized, have also
given the world treasures of wit, wisdom and
enjoyment.
</p>

<p>
One of the earliest forms used by men, when
they wanted to tell of some experience they had
had, was the fable.  A fable is a very brief,
simple story, generally a little story about animals.
Very early in the history of mankind, men
noticed animals, watched them, saw that the animals
often acted somewhat in the same way as men did
themselves, and were delighted and amused by
their cunning and cleverness.  It was natural
that people should begin by telling stories about
animals.
</p>

<p>
Here are two fables, one of an animal trying to
get the better of another animal, and the second
of two animals helping one another.  These
fables are said to have been made by Æsop.
</p>

<p>
A wolf seeing a goat feeding on the brow of a
high precipice where he could not come at her,
besought her to come down lower, for fear she
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P91"></a>91}</span>
should miss her footing at that dizzy height;
"And moreover," said he, "the grass is far
sweeter and more abundant here below."  But
the goat replied, "Excuse me; it is not for my
dinner that you invite me, but for your own."
</p>

<p>
The second fable tells of an ant falling into a
fountain of water where he was drinking
because he was thirsty and of the ant being nearly
drowned.  A dove dropped a leaf into the water
on which the ant climbed and so escaped.  A man
just then had almost caught the dove in a net, but
the ant bit him on the heel, the man started,
dropped his net and the dove flew away.  The fable
ends by saying that one good turn deserves another.
</p>

<p>
Fables as a rule were first told, it is believed,
not by famous people or great writers, but more
often by ordinary people who were not rich or
learned.  Perhaps they wanted to say something
about the politics of the country where they lived,
or about some ruler who was a tyrant.  They did
not wish to get into trouble, so they put what they
wanted to say into a little story.
</p>

<p>
Tradition tells us that Æsop, the most famous
maker of fables, was a slave, very misshapen in
body, and that he stammered when he spoke.
There is a collection of Æsop's and other Fables
in Everyman's Library.  Read some of these
little stories and remember how men, who were not
as free or as safe as we are to-day, made these
fables which are full of laughter, good temper,
and keen wit, and which are very wise.  We can
learn a great deal from fables, and we can enjoy
them at the same time.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P92"></a>92}</span>
</p>

<p>
Fairy tales are probably almost as old as
fables.  We all know how delightful fairy tales can
be.  Who would do without Jack the Giant
Killer, or Cinderella, or Silver Locks, or Blue
Beard, or Puss-in-Boots?  You can add many
more to the list.  Some fairy tales are very old,
but others are modern.  People sometimes say
that fairy tales are not true.  In a sense, perhaps,
they are right; that is, we do not expect to see
Jack cutting down and conquering a giant in a
day.  Yet the men who have perfected telegraph,
telephone and radio have overcome in a real way
the giant distance, and other men and women are
conquering daily, little by little, the great giant
disease.
</p>

<p>
The everyday world we live in is as wonderful
as a fairy tale, perhaps more wonderful.  Whenever
we find in a fairy tale, or in any other way,
a sense of the wonder of the world, and of life,
this is a very great gain, because then we know
that we are really seeing clearly, and understanding
what we see.  Most of all, perhaps, fairy tales
are meant to show us how beautiful the world is.
</p>

<p>
There are many good collections of fairy tales.
The long series of which Andrew Lang was editor
contains an excellent selection.  Grimm's
<i>Fairy Tales</i> are among the most famous in the
world.  Jacob and William Grimm were two
brothers, both of whom were learned professors.
Early in the nineteenth century, they published a
book of fairy tales which they had gathered by
listening to stories told in the nurseries and by
the firesides of their own country, Germany.  One
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P93"></a>93}</span>
of the prettiest of these stories is Snow-Drop and
the Seven Dwarfs.
</p>

<p>
Hans Andersen is, perhaps, the best loved of
all the writers of fairy stories.  He was born in
Odense in Denmark in 1805, and was a very poor
boy.  But he made a toy theatre for his amusement,
and no doubt began to make his stories at
the same time.  He wrote other books, but his
<i>Fairy Tales</i> are by far his best work.  Hans
Andersen was a genius.  His stories have such power
to touch our hearts that we want to be kind and
true and modest, following the example of his
heroes and heroines.  The world, especially the
world of homes, would be a poorer place if Hans
Andersen had never written The Wild Swans,
The Red Shoes, The Steadfast Tin Soldier, The
Little Match Girl, and especially The Ugly
Duckling.
</p>

<p>
Many of the most wonderful tales of magic
come out of the East.  The people of Arabia and
Egypt are gifted narrators of stories.  We owe
them our vast enjoyment of the stories in <i>The
Arabian Nights</i>.  These stories are very old
indeed; many of them must have come in the first
place from Persia and India.  Egypt supplies
much of what we call local colour.  The stories
were gathered together from different sources,
probably between 1450 and 1500; England then
was engaged in the long struggle know as the
Wars of the Roses.  It was not until 1704 that
Europeans first could read <i>The Arabian Nights</i>.
At that time a French professor, Antoine Galland,
published a French translation of a book of
Arabic stories.  It is odd to think that children
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P94"></a>94}</span>
of the English-speaking world did not know of
Ali Baba, or Sindbad, or Aladdin, until the time
of the reign of Queen Anne.  Now we all can
listen to the beautiful Schehera-zade telling her
thousand and one tales to her husband, the great
sultan Schah-riar, so that she would not be
executed before the last of the stories was finished.
Schah-riar was a tyrant, and a very spoiled
person.  But Schehera-zade was clever and resourceful,
and in the end saved herself.  These strange
stories of giants, genii, caliphs, and lovely
princesses are among the most famous in the world.
</p>

<p>
We come now to a different kind of book, <i>Morte
d'Arthur</i>, stories of King Arthur of Britain and
his Knights of the Bound Table.  These stories
Scott used to read when he was a boy, and so did
many another lad of genius who, when he was
older, never forgot the chivalry and the glory of
Malory's great book.  It may seem a curious book,
perhaps, to many of you when you first look at
it, for it is written in an older English than the
words we use; and the customs and the people
may appear strange and hard to understand.  Sir
Thomas Malory, who collected the stories and
translated most of them from French into
English, is supposed to have been a Lancastrian
knight who was thrown into prison in the Wars of
the Roses and kept there long years.  He spent
that weary time copying out by hand, for then
there were no printing presses, the book we know
as <i>Morte d'Arthur</i>.  Malory finished his work
in 1470.  Not long after his death, the manuscript
was brought to Caxton, who was the first great
printer in England, and Caxton printed the book
in 1485.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P95"></a>95}</span>
</p>

<p>
These are stories of heroes, in some far away
sense like <i>The Iliad</i> and <i>The Odyssey</i>, but they
are written in a wonderful prose, not like
Homer's even more wonderful poetry.  There is,
however, a great change in the lives of heroes between
the days of Homer and the days of Malory.  Let
us take one of Malory's stories, and try to see
what the change is.
</p>

<p>
The seventh book of <i>Morte d'Arthur</i> tells the
story of Beaumains, who was Gareth of Orkney
in disguise, and of how he won his knighthood.
Like many other young men of that time, Gareth
wanted to be one of King Arthur's Knights.
Gareth was well-born and wealthy, but he wished to
win honour and glory&mdash;what Malory calls
worship&mdash;by worthy deeds, so he came in disguise to
Arthur's Court.
</p>

<p>
He asked three petitions, and the King granted
them.  The first was that he might be given
food and drink and lodging for a year.  At
the end of that time, he would ask for his other
two petitions.  Sir Kay, who was the steward,
thought only a poor-spirited fellow would ask for
meat and drink, so he gave him lodging and food
with the boys in the kitchen, and called him
Beaumains, fair hands, or as people sometimes say
now lily fingers.  Beaumains waited the year,
then a damsel came asking for a knight to rescue
her lady who was besieged in a castle, but she
would not tell her name.  King Arthur said he
would not let any of his knights go unless she told
the name.  Then Beaumains made his other petitions.
The first was that he might be commissioned
to go with the damsel and rescue the lady,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P96"></a>96}</span>
and the second that he might joust with the great
knight, Sir Launcelot of the Lake, and win
knighthood from him.  King Arthur gave his consent.
Beaumains jousted with Sir Launcelot and won
his knighthood.  But the damsel was very angry,
and said she had been given only a kitchen page.
Beaumains went with her in spite of her angry
abuse, fought with many knights and overcame
them, and finally rescued the Lady Lionesse who
was the damsel's sister.  The damsel's name was
Linet.  Thus Sir Gareth won great honour and
worship.
</p>

<p>
What really is this honour&mdash;the worship of
which Malory writes?  Knighthood was won by
being brave, and by doing mighty deeds.  But
the true spirit of knighthood&mdash;the very essence of
it, as we say&mdash;is shown by one test; the deeds
must be unselfish.  The knight was a rescuer; he
was a righter of other people's wrongs.  When
King Arthur lived, people had begun to learn that
the most heroic life is the self-sacrificing life.
When Linet was abusing Beaumains, and telling
him that he would never accomplish the great
adventure on which his hopes were set, the only
answer he made to her was, "I shall assay."  This
means, "I shall try."  It was a noble answer.
There is still only one way of winning true honour
by unselfish deeds.  First, one must have the
desire, then those who desire must also try.  As
Beaumains said, "I shall assay."

CHAPTER XV
<br><br>
ALICE IN WONDERLAND&mdash;THROUGH THE LOOKING-GLASS&mdash;THE
GOLDEN AGE&mdash;WIND IN THE WILLOWS&mdash;FOUR
BOOKS BY A. A. MILNE&mdash;RIP VAN WINKLE
</h3>

<p>
The story begins with a chapter called Down
the Rabbit-Hole.  Alice was feeling sleepy,
you remember, when suddenly she saw a
white rabbit with pink eyes running by close
beside her.  She thought nothing of that.  She was
not surprised even when she heard the rabbit saying
to itself, "Oh dear!  Oh dear!  I shall be too
late!"  But when the rabbit took a watch out of
its waist-coat pocket, looked at it and then
hurried on, Alice started to her feet, ran across the
field, and was just in time to see the Rabbit pop
down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.
</p>

<p>
The name of the story, as most of you know,
is <i>Alice in Wonderland</i>.  All over the
English-speaking world, children, and older people as
well, seem to know Alice.
</p>

<p>
When you hear someone talking about the Mad
Hatter at the tea party, or a blue caterpillar
smoking a hookah, or the Duchess losing her temper,
or the cat vanishing but the smile remaining,
and you ask what it means, you will be told, if you
have not guessed already, that all these odd
phrases belong to <i>Alice in Wonderland</i>.
</p>

<p>
Alice followed the White Rabbit down the hole,
falling down a very long way without hurting
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P98"></a>98}</span>
herself a bit.  Then she found herself in a hall where
there was a three-legged table with a tiny gold
key on it, and she discovered a little door that she
opened with the tiny gold key, but she was too big
to go through the door, although she could see
that it led into the loveliest garden.  Then, as you
may remember, she found a bottle with "Drink
me" printed on it, and when she saw that it was
not marked poison, she tasted it, and since it had
a very good taste, she drank it all, and after that
she was only ten inches high.  Then she had
forgotten the key, and now she was too small to reach
to the top of the table, but under the table she saw
a glass box and in the box a cake with "Eat me"
marked on it beautifully in currants.  And so,
finally, with the help of the cake, and then with
the help of a fan, of which you must read for
yourselves, Alice found her way into the garden;
and after that she had the most curious adventures.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps no one can explain the exact reason
why we enjoy <i>Alice in Wonderland</i> so much.  The
story is so precisely what we should like it to be,
that we take it as it is, and hurry on through its
pages in a sort of breathless happiness, wanting
to know only what comes next.  There is nothing
puzzling or difficult in the story, no hidden
meanings, nothing to make one sad or discontented,
only laughter and curious, amusing incidents.
It is a perfect story about the strange
adventures of a little girl, and most people find
delight in it.  There is a sequel to the story of
Alice, called <i>Through the Looking-Glass</i>.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P99"></a>99}</span>
</p>

<p>
Lewis Carroll is the name you will find printed
on the title pages of these stories, but this is a pen
name.  The author's real name was Dodgson.  He
did not like people to know that he wrote
children's books.  Lewis Carroll seems to have been
a quiet, shy man, a mathematician who wrote
difficult books for students, but he was wonderfully
fond of children and understood how to write
stories that they would like.
</p>

<p>
Most of the books spoken of in this chapter
ought to be read aloud.  They are generally called
children's stories, but without exception they are
also books that are loved and keenly enjoyed by
older people.  You will not need to think of giving
them up when you grow older.  They really belong
to all ages.  If you take the trouble to learn
how to read aloud well, perhaps you may be the
first to read <i>Alice in Wonderland</i> to some small
person, younger than you are.  It is great pleasure
to introduce anyone to a really delightful book.
</p>

<p>
<i>The Golden Age</i> and <i>The Wind in the Willows</i>
are two stories written for boys and girls by
Kenneth Grahame.  The first story is about Harold,
Charlotte, Edward, Selina, and the boy who tells
the story.  They lived with their uncles and aunts
in a small town or village.  The children,
perhaps, were rather lonely, but they made games
and adventures for themselves, and it is pleasant
to read about them.  They had pets like many
other children, and they made games from the
books they were reading, like <i>The Arabian
Nights</i>, and the <i>Story of Ulysses</i>, and <i>King
Arthur and his Round Table</i>.  <i>The Golden
Age</i> is an English story.  It is one of the books
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P100"></a>100}</span>
that will tell you accurately and delightfully of
the lives of boys and girls who live in the
country in England, in the same way that <i>Tom
Sawyer</i> and <i>Huckleberry Finn</i> tell us about boys in
the United States.  But, of course, we know that
all boys in the States do not live as Tom and
Huckleberry did.  Girls and boys in England live
in different ways also.  It depends a good deal
on the part of the country the author is writing
about and on the circumstances of the families to
which the boys and girls belong.  Miss
L. M. Montgomery's stories of Prince Edward Island
in the same way tell a good deal about the lives
of boys and girls in Canada.
</p>

<p>
<i>The Wind in the Willows</i> is a wise, delightful
and amusing story about animals,&mdash;a mole, a rabbit,
a water rat, a badger, an otter, a toad, hedgehogs,
field mice, stoats and weasels.  We hear a
good deal about birds too, especially swallows.
Toad, Badger, Mole and Water Rat were great
friends, and we are as much interested in their
doings as if they were friends of ours as well.
</p>

<p>
Books have many curious and strange characteristics.
Some books, as we have learned, live
for thousands of years.  Homer's songs and the
books of the Bible were kept at first, not in print,
but in various other ways.  But, now-a-days,
hundreds of books are printed every year which in a
little while are forgotten and no one reads them
again.  It is deeply interesting to ponder over
what makes a book live.  We think we can
recognize sometimes which of the new books will
continue to be read, and which, although they may
be pleasant enough to read once, are not likely to
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P101"></a>101}</span>
be known for more than a few years.  The truth
is that no one can foretell accurately how long a
book will last, or which books will last longest.
For instance, it is not likely that when Lewis
Carrol wrote <i>Alice in Wonderland</i> he had any idea
that the story would make him famous when his
other books were forgotten.  Only one thing can
test this lasting quality in a book; that one thing
is time.  So you can think of time, if you like, as
a great umpire deciding which books will keep on
living, and which will be forgotten.
</p>

<p>
There are four little books that have been
written in the last few years which may last a long
while, although, of course, no one can be sure
about this until time decides.  These four little
books are <i>When We were Very Young</i>, <i>Winnie
the Pooh</i>, <i>Now We Are Six</i>, and <i>The House at
Pooh Corner</i>, two books in poetry and two in
prose, by A. A. Milne.  They tell about Christopher
Robin and his toys.  These are very delightful
books to read aloud to little people.  But they
belong also to people of all ages.
</p>

<p>
An American writer, called Washington Irving,
who was born as long ago as 1783, in New York,
once wrote a story called <i>Rip Van Winkle</i>, which
is not exactly a fairy story, or a story of magic;
and yet it has a great deal of magic in it.  The
tale is about a man who was what is called a
ne'er-do-well.  He liked to hunt and shoot, but not to
work.  One day, he went off into the mountains
with his dog Wolf.  He heard sounds like thunder,
and he met an odd, square-built old fellow who
asked him by signs to help him carry a keg up
the mountain.  Then they came on a group of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P102"></a>102}</span>
men, all dressed in a by-gone fashion, who were
playing bowls.  None of these men spoke to Rip
Van Winkle, who helped himself several times
from the keg, and by and by fell asleep.  When
he awoke, he found his way back to the mountain
village where his home was, and discovered that
he had been asleep twenty years.  <i>Rip Van
Winkle</i> is one of the very few tales of magic which
has been written of any part of the North American
continent.  Most of the stories of this
character of which we have been speaking belong to
older countries.

CHAPTER XVI
<br><br>
THE JUNGLE BOOKS&mdash;JUST SO STORIES&mdash;PUCK OF
POOK'S HILL&mdash;REWARDS AND FAIRIES&mdash;THE
BLUE BIRD&mdash;PETER PAN&mdash;KILMENY
</h3>

<p>
<i>The Jungle Book</i> by Rudyard Kipling was
first published as a book in 1894.  Some of
the stories had appeared in the magazine
<i>St. Nicholas</i> before that date.  <i>The Second
Jungle Book</i> was published in 1895.  Kipling was
born in Bombay, India, in 1865.  It gives one a
wonderful, very delightful thrill to take up a book
by a new writer, whose name one has never heard
before, and after reading a little while, to find
oneself convinced that this unknown author has
unmistakable genius.  Some day you will likely
have the pleasure of discovering for yourselves
a writer of, perhaps, the first rank.  The
grand-fathers and grand-mothers or perhaps the fathers
and mothers of boys and girls to-day experienced
this thrill when they read for the first time one
of Kipling's short stories of India.
</p>

<p>
Rudyard Kipling had been writing nearly ten
years, and was a well-known author, before he
published <i>The Jungle Books</i>, which are his first
books for young people.  Like some other books
for boys and girls, older people are fascinated by
them also.  Kipling's father, John Lockwood
Kipling, was an Englishman in the Indian Civil
Service.  His mother was the daughter of a
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P104"></a>104}</span>
Wesleyan minister, whose sons and daughters all have
showed distinguished ability.  Kipling lived in
India when he was a child.  While he was still a
small boy, he was sent home to school in England.
But from his child's recollections of India have
come pictures of Indian life, and an understanding
and interpretation of the people of that
widely-spreading, mysterious country with its
swarming population, its plains, mountains, and deep
jungles where lions, tigers and many other
animals live, which are unparalleled elsewhere in
English literature.
</p>

<p>
Carried safely and swiftly by the magic of Kipling's
stories, we may all visit the Indian jungle,
hear Shere Khan, the tiger, roar, stand with the
Lone Wolf on the Council Rock, learn to know
Bagheera, the Black Panther, Baloo, the bear,
Hathi, the elephant and many more of the jungle
people, as well as Father Wolf, Mother Wolf, and
the Pack.  The Man cub, the boy Mowgli, is the
pattern and epitome of what every boy likes to be,
brave, resourceful, loyal, quick to see and hold
advantage, staunch in friendship, fond of play,
longing to do great deeds, and now and then
showing that he is capable.  The stories of Mowgli
are collected in <i>The Jungle Book</i>.  In <i>The Second
Jungle Book</i> are such stories as Rikki-tikki-tavi,
the Mongoose; the White Seal; Toomai of the
Elephants; and Her Majesty's Servants, which is a
tale of the animals of a military camp.  None of
us to-day can imagine how any writer could
possibly create finer stories of animals than
Kipling has written in <i>The Jungle Books</i>.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P105"></a>105}</span>
</p>

<p>
It is not easy to try to tell how charming and
wise are the <i>Just So Stories</i>, told in Kipling's
book for little people known by that name.  Much
of the tenderness that fathers and mothers feel
for the very youngest, and that you feel for your
small brothers and sisters, if you have brothers
and sisters younger than you are, shines in these
stories.  Here, too, you will find laughter, very
sweet and merry, and much wise understanding,
not only of animals and children, but of the great
world and its history.  Some of the more noted
of the tales in <i>Just So Stories</i> are: How the Camel
Got His Hump; How the Rhinoceros Got His
Skin; The Elephant's Child; The Sing-Song of
Old Man Kangaroo; The Beginning of the
Armadillos; and The Cat that Walked by Himself.
There are six more stories that perhaps are as
wonderful as those which have been named.  <i>Just
So Stories</i> was published in 1902.
</p>

<p>
Kipling has written as well two books of stories
which reveal to young people in a remarkable
way the course and glory of English history.
These books could have been written only for one
reason, to help and delight Kipling's own
children.  The books are called <i>Puck of Pook's Hill</i>
and <i>Rewards and Fairies</i>.  Una and Dan are the
names of the children who have the adventures
told of in these books, and who see far, far back
into the past of England.  With Pict, Roman,
Dane, Saxon, Norman, soldiers, peasants, Jews,
priests, Crusaders, squires, dames, knights, down
to the time of the great sea captains and Sir
Francis Drake, this famous writer unfolds the pageant
of English history in an incomparable way for
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P106"></a>106}</span>
boys and girls belonging to the twentieth century.
<i>Puck of Pook's Hill</i> appeared first in 1906; and
<i>Rewards and Fairies</i> in 1909.
</p>

<p>
Not many years ago Maurice Maeterlinck, a
Belgian poet, wrote for every one, old and young,
a fairy play called <i>The Blue Bird</i>.  You may
sometimes see the play acted in a theatre, or you
may read the scenes and acts of the play in a
book.  First of all, in the book, come the names
of all the characters, and then a description of
the costumes in which they are dressed.  Tyltyl
and Mytyl, a brother and sister, for the sake of
a neighbour's child, go away from home into
strange, marvellous places, looking for the blue
bird, Happiness.  Tyltyl wears scarlet knickerbockers,
pale-blue jacket, white stockings, tan
shoes, which is the way Hop o' My Thumb is
dressed.  Mytyl is dressed like Little Red
Riding-hood.  <i>The Blue Bird</i> is a fairy story, a
wonderful story, and true, as we say, spiritually.
The brother and sister, when they are at home,
live in a wood-cutter's cottage.  On their travels,
they visit the Land of Memory, the Palace of
Night, a great forest, the Palace of Happiness, a
graveyard, and the Kingdom of the Future.
Tylo, the dog, and Tylette, the cat, are two of the
most important characters; and in the play, you
will meet people called Bread, Sugar, Fire,
Water, Milk, and many more familiar to you in
everyday life, but not in the same shape.  <i>The
Blue Bird</i> is a wonderful fairy play.  When you
read it, you will discover whether or not Tyltyl
and Mytyl find the bluebird, Happiness.

Everyone is likely to have heard of Peter Pan,
the boy who would not grow up.  You may have
seen the play, <i>Peter Pan</i>, acted on a stage, or you
may have read the story in a book.  Barrie, who
wrote the play, was born in a village in Scotland,
called Kirriemuir, in the year 1860.  He is a
novelist as well as a playwright.  His full name
is James Matthew Barrie, and because his novels
and plays are so pleasing, and whimsical, very
many people have a special feeling of love and
kindness for Barrie.
</p>

<p>
<i>Peter Pan</i> is a delightful play; and the story
<i>Peter Pan</i> is almost as enjoyable.  The three
Darling children, Wendy, John and Michael, are
taught by Peter Pan how to fly, and they fly away
with him to the Never-Never Land.  Here are the
lost boys, Slightly, Tootles, Nibs and Curly, and
the crocodile, Captain Hook and his pirates,
mermaids, redskins, and Tinker Bell, the fairy who
is devoted to Peter Pan.  In the end, the Darling
children return to their father and mother.  Peter
Pan chooses to stay in the Never-Never Land;
but once a year, at the time of spring cleaning,
Wendy goes back to keep house for him for a
little while.
</p>

<p>
So we learn that fairy stories, very wonderful
fairy stories, are still being written to-day as they
were long years ago when the world was younger.
Beauty, fantasy, and magic belong to us all.  The
love of these things calls us, as it were, with a
very sweet voice, and when we hear that call&mdash;often
from a book&mdash;we recognize it as the spirit
of the fairy story.  Sometimes the spirit of a
fairy tale is caught perfectly and beautifully in
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P108"></a>108}</span>
a poem.  You will find such a poem in the
collection known as <i>The Oxford Book of English Verse</i>.
The name of the poem is "Kilmeny", and the
name of the man who wrote it is James Hogg, or,
as he is often called, The Ettrick Shepherd.  He
was a friend of Sir Walter Scott.  "Kilmeny" has
the same magic that Barrie's plays show so
remarkably.
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Late, late in gloamin' when all was still,<br>
  When the fringe was red on the westlin hill,<br>
  The wood was sere, the moon i' the wane,<br>
  The reek o' the cot hung over the plain,<br>
  Like a little wee cloud in the world its lane;<br>
  When the ingle low'd wi' an eiry leme,<br>
  Late, late in the gloamin' Kilmeny came hame!<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
You may not know what some of these words
mean.  Gloaming is twilight; westlin is western;
reek is smoke; its lane means all by itself; ingle
is the open fire-place; low'd is flamed; eiry leme
is eery gleam.

BALLADS, LAYS AND STORIES IN VERSE

CHAPTER XVII
<br><br>
PERCY'S RELIQUES&mdash;CHEVY CHASE AND THE BATTLE
OF OTTERBOURNE&mdash;SIR PATRICK SPENS&mdash;THE
NORTHERN MUSE
</h3>

<p>
A ballad is a simple tale told in simple
verse.  These tales in verse may be very
old, or they may have been composed only
a few years ago.  But, generally speaking, the
old ballads are best.  The world seems to have
lost the art of telling stories in verse as simply
and naturally as people could many hundreds of
years ago.
</p>

<p>
The old ballads are like old fairy tales; no one
knows when they were first told or sung.  It
seems likely that they were made, not by great
people or distinguished scholars, but by simple,
ordinary people, to be sung or told to other
simple, ordinary people.  You will remember that
fables in the same way were likely told first by
one neighbour to another.  Ballads and fairy
tales and fables, long before books or newspapers
were printed, were ways in which everyday
people handed down from fathers and mothers to
sons and daughters, chronicles and history,
learning and good advice, wise sayings, and notable
happenings.
</p>

<p>
After a long time, very many years, people who
enjoyed these ballads, as soon as they knew how
to write, began to write them down.  Apparently,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P112"></a>112}</span>
no one thought much about the songs for a while.
Then scholars who were fond of ancient songs
looked for and treasured the old ballads.  One
of the first and most famous collectors of ballads
was Bishop Percy who published his <i>Reliques of
Ancient English Poetry</i> in 1765.  Sir Walter
Scott's <i>Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border</i> was
published in 1802.  Bishop Percy reproduced, as
part of his collection, an old manuscript of
ballads which he had rescued from being used by a
maid to light a fire.
</p>

<p>
Ballads belong to many countries, and oddly
enough, the same stories are sometimes sung in
different words in many of these countries.  In
English poetry, a number of the finest ballads
come from the borders between England and
Scotland before these two countries were joined.
"Chevy Chase" and "The Battle of Otterbourne"
were sung of raids and wars between the English
and the Scots.  Other countries famous for their
ballads are Greece, France, Provence, Portugal,
Denmark and Italy.
</p>

<p>
The ballads called "Chevy Chase" and "The
Battle of Otterbourne" perhaps have become
confused one with the other.  Part of "Chevy Chase"
seems to have found its way into "The Battle of
Otterbourne".  There are many different versions
of these ballads.  The versions written by
English balladists tell how the English defeated
the Scots; on the other hand, the Scots versions
say that the Scots were victors.
</p>

<p>
Here is part of "The Battle of Otterbourne",
taken from Scott's <i>Minstrelsy</i>.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P113"></a>113}</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  It fell upon the Lammas tide,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the muir-men win their hay,<br>
  The doughty Douglas bound him to ride<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into England, to drive a prey.<br>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  And he marched up to Newcastle,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And rode it round about;<br>
  "O wha's the lord of this castle,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or wha's the lady o't?"<br>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  But up spoke proud Lord Percy then,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And O but he spake hie!<br>
  "I am the Lord of this castle,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My wife's the lady gay."<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Lord Percy and the Douglas agreed to fight
with their men at Otterbourne in three days.
Percy wounded the Douglas to his death and the
Douglas sent for his nephew Sir Hugh Montgomery.
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "My wound is deep; I fain would sleep;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take thou the vanguard of the three,<br>
  And hide me by the braken bush,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That grows on yonder lily lea.<br>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "O bury me by the braken bush,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beneath the blooming brier,<br>
  Let never living mortal ken<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That a kindly Scot lies here."<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Later in the battle, Sir Hugh Montgomery and
Lord Percy fought, and Sir Hugh was the victor.
He said to Lord Percy to yield, who answered to
whom must he yield!
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Thou shalt not yield to lord or loun,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor yet shalt thou yield to me;<br>
  But yield thee to the braken bush,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That grows upon yon lily lea!"<br>
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P114"></a>114}</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "I will not yield to a braken bush,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor yet will I yield to a brier;<br>
  But I would yield to Earl Douglas,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or Sir Hugh Montgomery, if he were here."<br>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  As soon as he knew it was Montgomery,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He struck his sword's point in the ground;<br>
  The Montgomery was a courteous knight,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And quickly took him by the hand.<br>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  This deed was done at Otterbourne<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About the breaking of the day;<br>
  Earl Douglas was buried at the braken bush,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Percy led captive away.<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Little is known from history of the story told
in "Sir Patrick Spens".  It was first published by
Bishop Percy in his <i>Reliques</i>.  Princess
Margaret of Scotland was married to Prince Eric of
Norway in 1281.  The ballad of "Sir Patrick
Spens" may possibly have some reference to this
historical event, but no one can say so with
certainty.  We learn from the ballad that Sir
Patrick Spens was a splendid seaman, and that the
Scots king gave him a commission to sail to
Norway and bring home the king's daughter.  But
it was late in the year.  The waters would be
stormy; and Sir Patrick knew that he and his
men would be in peril of their lives.  They sailed
to Norway, which is called Noroway in the ballad,
and had been there a week only when the lords
of Noroway began to complain that the Scots
were costly guests.  Sir Patrick answered that
they had brought white money and good red gold,
more than enough to pay for all they cost, but
that he would sail immediately.  His sailors told
him that they had seen signs of a storm.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P115"></a>115}</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "I saw the new moon late yestreen,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wi' the auld moon in her arm;<br>
  And if we gang to sea, master,<br>

</p>

<p class="poem">
  They hadna mailed a league, a league,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A league but barely three,<br>

</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Sir Patrick must have been steering the ship
himself, for he asked for a volunteer to take the
helm while he went up to the tall topmast, to see
if he could spy land.  A sailor took the helm, but
Sir Patrick had only gone a step when a bolt flew
out of the good ship and the salt water came in.
They tried to stop the leak but failed, and Sir
Patrick and his men were lost.

<p>
"Sir Patrick Spens" is a wonderful old ballad.
Most of the words, old as they are, you will
understand.  In the second verse quoted, lift means
sky; a gurly sea is a stormy sea.  Goud kames in
the verse before the last means gold combs.
</p>

<p>
Mr. John Buchan a few years ago made a
collection of Scottish poetry called <i>The Northern
Muse</i>.  In it, you may read a number of famous
ballads.  There are also many delightful old
songs which tell of the lives of ordinary folk,
or people, in their everyday work.  Turn specially
to number sixty-six, which is the famous,
beautiful old song of a woman, a good wife, who
is getting ready for the homecoming of her
husband; it is called "There's nae Luck about the
House".  Number sixty-eight is a song of fishing
people.  These are not exactly ballads, but they
are written, as we say, almost in the same mood
as a ballad.  An amusing song about a clever
small boy is number one hundred and eighty; it
is a ballad, and is called "The False Knight Upon
the Road".  In days long ago people believed in
witches and wizards.
</p>

<p>
The false knight is supposed to be a wizard.
If the small boy had not been quick enough to
give him an answer to every question, the wizard,
people thought then, might carry him away.  Now
listen to the small boy.
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "O whare are ye gaun?"<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quo' the fause knicht upon the road:<br>
  "I'm gaun to the scule,"<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quo' the wee boy, and still he stude.<br>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "What is that upon your back?"<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quo' the fause knicht upon the road:<br>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P117"></a>117}</span>
  "Atweel it is my bukes,"<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quo' the wee boy, and still he stude.<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
And so on to the end of the story.  Scule, of
course, is school, and bukes are books.  Stude is
stood.

<h3>
CHAPTER XVIII
<br><br>
THE LADY OF THE LAKE&mdash;MARMION&mdash;JOHN GILPIN&mdash;EDINBURGH
AFTER FLODDEN&mdash;HORATIUS&mdash;THE ARMADA
</h3>

<p>
In times of war, as you know, people
sometimes have to go into hiding.  Long ago, a
nobleman, Earl Douglas, who lived during
the reign of King James V of Scotland, had
offended the King, or rather some words he was
falsely reported to have uttered had been told
the King, and he was in danger of imprisonment.
Earl Douglas took refuge in the Highlands of
Scotland with his kinsman, Sir Roderick Dhu, the
head or chief of the clan Alpine, who was unwilling
to acknowledge that he owed allegiance to
anyone.  Ellen Douglas, a very beautiful young
woman, shared her father's exile.  As it
happened, King James went on a hunting expedition
as a knight, not a king, in the same part of his
kingdom.  There he met Ellen, who had never
seen the King and did not know who he was.  The
King called himself James Fitz-James.  Roderick
Dhu, who is in love with Ellen, plans a rising
of his clan.  Fitz-James is brave.  He is in peril,
but he wishes to extricate himself without calling
on his soldiers.  The story is told by Sir Walter
Scott in a poem called <i>The Lady of the Lake</i>.  You
will find this romance in verse easy to read and
very interesting.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P119"></a>119}</span>
</p>

<p>
The scene is laid in the West Highlands of
Perthshire.  Much of what happens takes place
in the neighbourhood of a beautiful lake, Loch
Katrine.  Scott, you will remember, is a master
in the description of romantic scenery.  After
a short introduction, the story begins with an
account of stag-hunting.  James Fitz-James and a
few of his men are the hunters.
</p>

<p class="poem">
  The stag at eve had drunk his fill,<br>
  Where danced the moon on Monan's rill,<br>
  And deep his midnight lair had made<br>
  In lone Glenartney's hazel shade;<br>
  But, when the sun his beacon red<br>
  Had kindled on Benvoirlich's head,<br>
  The deep-mouthed bloodhound's heavy bay<br>
  Resounded up the rocky way,<br>
  And faint, from farther distance borne,<br>
  Were heard the clanging hoof and horn.<br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
The tale is made to unroll itself like a picture
before our eyes.  The scenes are wonderfully
picturesque, and the story is exciting.  What
happens to Ellen, Roderick Dhu, young Malcolm
Graeme who also is in love with Ellen and whom
she loves, and to Fitz-James, you must discover
for yourself by reading <i>The Lady of the Lake</i>.
</p>

<p>
But before leaving the poem, let us quote part
of the stanza which tells how in answer to
Fitz-James's wish, Roderick Dhu gives the signal
which calls his men from hiding in the glen where
he and Fitz-James are to take leave of each other.
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Have then thy wish!"&mdash;he whistled shrill,<br>
  And he was answered from the hill;<br>
  Wild as the scream of the curlew,<br>
  From crag to crag the signal flew.<br>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P120"></a>120}</span>
  Instant, through copse and heath, arose<br>
  Bonnets, and spears, and bended bows;<br>
  On right, on left, above, below,<br>
  Sprung up at once the lurking foe;<br>
  From shingles gray their lances start,<br>
  The bracken-bush sends forth the dart,<br>
  The rushes and the willow-wand<br>
  Are bristling into axe and brand,<br>
  And every tuft of broom gives life<br>
  To plaided warrior armed for strife.<br>
  That whistle garrisoned the glen<br>
  At once with full five hundred men.<br>
  . . . . . . . . . . .<br>
  Watching their leader's beck and will,<br>
  All silent there they stood and still;<br>
  . . . . . . . . . . .<br>
  The mountaineer cast glance of pride<br>
  Along Benledi's living side,<br>
  Then fixed his eye and sable brow<br>
  Full on Fitz-James&mdash;"How say'st thou now?<br>
  These are Clan-Alpine's warriors true;<br>
  And, Saxon,&mdash;I am Roderick Dhu!"<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
<i>Marmion</i> is one of the most romantic and
moving of Scott's narratives.  Lord Marmion is
a fictitious character.  Scott wished to tell the
story of Flodden Field, a battle fought between
the English and the Scotch in 1513 in which the
English were victorious.  It was a most disastrous
battle for the Scots, who lost their King
and the flower of their nobility.  Lord Marmion,
who was an Englishman, and many among the
English, were also slain.  The poem opens with a
vivid description of life in England and Scotland
in the Middle Ages.  We visit a feudal castle in
England, Norham Castle, where Sir Hugh Heron
welcomes Lord Marmion.  A Palmer returning
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P121"></a>121}</span>
from the Holy Land has also come to Norham Castle.
</p>

<p class="poem">
  His sable cowl o'erhung his face;<br>
  In his black mantle was he clad,<br>
  With Peter's keys, in cloth of red,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On his broad shoulders wrought,<br>
  The scallop shell, his cap did deck;<br>
  The crucifix around his neck<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was from Loretto brought;<br>
  His sandals were with travel tore;<br>
  Staff, budget, bottle, scrip, he wore;<br>
  The faded palm branch in his hand<br>
  Showed pilgrim from the Holy Land.<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
We visit as well, by the magic of Scott's verses,
a convent, a monastery and an inn, and learn
many things of the way in which people lived in
the Middle Ages.  It is in <i>Marmion</i> that we find
one of Sir Walter Scott's famous songs, "Lochinvar",
which is introduced in the fifth canto.  But
the most memorable part of <i>Marmion</i> is the
description of the battle of Flodden with which
the poem concludes.  The sixth canto tells the
story of the battle.  Turn to the thirty-fourth
stanza of that canto, and you may read how the
Scots tried to save their king.  These lines are
judged to be among the noblest that Sir Walter
Scott ever wrote.  Other tales in verse by Scott
are <i>The Lay of the Last Minstrel</i>, <i>Rokeby</i>, and <i>The
Lord of the Isles</i>.
</p>

<p>
Four stories by other writers of verse, which
you will like, and in which you will find humour
or heroic valour, are told somewhat in the fashion
of ballads or lays; we listen to them with special
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P122"></a>122}</span>
enjoyment when they are spoken by a skilled
reciter.
</p>

<p>
The first of these is "The Diverting History of
John Gilpin", showing how he went farther than
he intended, and came safe home again.  It was
written by the English poet Cowper who, although
he was often sad himself, in this story has left as
wholesome and carefree humour as anyone may
wish to discover in a story.  John Gilpin was a
London citizen of long ago.  His wife said that,
although they had been married twenty years, they
had never had a holiday.  She proposed that they
should take her sister, and her sister's child, and
their own three children, and drive to an inn at
Edmonton not far away.  But, since the carriage
would be crowded, John Gilpin was to come on
horseback.  John was delayed, first by one thing,
then another, but finally got started.  Then his
horse wanted to trot, and John was not a good
rider.  Besides that, he had two stone bottles of
wine, one tied to each side of his leathern belt.
The horse ran away with John.  He lost his wig.
The stone bottles were broken.  The horse raced
past the inn at Edmonton where his wife and
children were waiting, and galloped on to its
owner's house at Ware which was ten miles
further.  The friend who had lent Gilpin the horse
asked what it was all about.  John, who was a
plucky, good-humoured fellow, and loved a joke,
answered him.
</p>

<p class="poem">
  I came because your horse would come,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, if I well forebode,<br>
  My hat and wig will soon be here,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are upon the road.<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P123"></a>123}</span>
</p>

<p>
His friend started him back to Edmonton, but
even yet John had adventures.  There was to be
no family dinner at Edmonton that day.  Yet John
Gilpin at last got safe home as you may read in
Cowper's story.
</p>

<p>
"Edinburgh After Flodden", by a writer called
Aytoun, is the story of how the people of
Edinburgh first heard the news of the great defeat.
Most people, certainly most boys and girls, must
thrill as they read the opening stanza.
</p>

<p class="poem">
  News of battle!&mdash;news of battle!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hark! 'tis ringing down the street:<br>
  And the archways and the pavement<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bear the clang of hurrying feet.<br>
  News of battle! who hath brought it?<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;News of triumph?  Who should bring<br>
  Tidings from our noble army,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Greetings from our gallant King?<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
These lines are part only of the first stanza.
They are taken from the book known as Aytoun's
<i>Lays of the Scottish Cavaliers</i>.
</p>

<p>
Lord Macaulay, who was a distinguished
historian, wrote a famous <i>History of England</i>.
He wrote also a number of lays, or stories in
verse.  Some of the best-known are about the
deeds of the Romans, that remarkable people who
gave the world much that is great in law and
government.  You likely will have heard of the
story of Horatius, who, with two others, held the
bridge over the Tiber, and saved Rome when
Lars Porsena came with an army to take the city.
It is a famous story.  Read it, in Macaulay's <i>Lays
of Ancient Rome</i>.  The last poem in this same
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P124"></a>124}</span>
book of lays is called "The Armada".  It also tells
a thrilling tale.  What a pity it would be if any
mischievous sprite were to take away and hide
the books in which are the stories written of in
this chapter!

CHAPTER XIX
<br><br>
HIAWATHA&mdash;FRENCH CHANSONS IN QUEBEC&mdash;A
CHRISTMAS SONG<br>
</h3>

<p>
Henry Wadsworth Longfellow
was born in Portland, which is in the state
of Maine, in the year 1807.  His father and
mother both belonged to families that had been
settled in the States for a number of generations.
He was of a scholarly disposition, and studied and
travelled to fit himself for writing and teaching.
He became Smith Professor of Modern Languages
at Harvard when he was twenty-seven
years old.  From that time, he was closely
associated with the town of Cambridge, near Boston,
in Massachusetts.  Harvard University is situated
in Cambridge.  You may still visit the house
where Longfellow lived.  In a pleasant small
park near the house, there is a statue of the poet.
He was fond of children, and loved to have them
near him.
</p>

<p>
<i>The Song of Hiawatha</i> was written specially
for the delight of young people.  It is a story in
verse, telling of a leader among North American
Indians, one of themselves, who was to rescue
and help his people, aiding them to clear their
fishing grounds, to find food, and to live more
comfortably and peaceably than in the past.
</p>

<p>
Hiawatha and his people in Longfellow's story
are supposed to live on the south shore of Lake
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P126"></a>126}</span>
Superior, the largest of the Great Lakes.  The
scene of the story is between the Pictured Rocks
and the Grand Sable.
</p>

<p>
The poem begins by telling of a sweet singer
among the Indians.  The singer first sings of the
Master of Life; this is a translation of the name
which to the Indians means God, Gitche Manito,
the Great Spirit.  After that, he sings of the four
winds, North-wind, South-wind, East-wind,
West-wind.  Then we come to Hiawatha's childhood.
He lived with his grandmother, old Nokomis.  His
mother was Wenonah, but she died when
Hiawatha was born.
</p>

<p class="poem">
  By the shining Big-Sea-Water,<br>
  Stood the wigwam of Nokomis,<br>
  Daughter of the Moon, Nokomis.<br>
  Dark behind it rose the forest,<br>
  Rose the black and gloomy pine-trees,<br>
  Rose the firs with cones upon them;<br>
  Bright before it beat the water,<br>
  Beat the clear and sunny water,<br>
  Beat the shining Big-Sea-Water.<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Here Hiawatha was brought up.  He saw the
fire-flies, and heard the owls, and he learned to
know the name and language of all birds and
beasts.  When he was old enough, Iagoo, who was
a friend of Nokomis, made him a bow and arrows,
and told him to bring home a roebuck so that
they all might have food.  After this, Hiawatha
meets his father, Mudjekeewis, the West-wind,
who had gone away and left his mother.  Indian
stories, like Greek stories, tell of the immortals
coming down to earth.  Hiawatha had a great
struggle or contest with Mudjekeewis, who had
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P127"></a>127}</span>
deserted Wenonah, and Hiawatha, now a young
man, was such a mighty warrior that Mudjekeewis
could scarcely withstand him.  At last he said to
Hiawatha,
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Hold, my son, my Hiawatha!<br>
  'Tis impossible to kill me,<br>
  For you cannot kill the immortal.<br>
  I have put you to this trial,<br>
  But to know and prove your courage;<br>
  Now receive the prize of valour!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go back to your home and people,<br>
  Live among them, toil among them,<br>
  Cleanse the earth from all that harms it,<br>
  Clear the fishing-grounds and rivers,<br>
  Slay all monsters and magicians,<br>
  All the giants, the Wendigoes,<br>
  All the serpents, the Kenabeeks,<br>
  As I slew the Mishe-Mokwa,<br>
  Slew the Great Bear of the mountains."<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
On his way home, Hiawatha was buying arrow-heads
from the arrow-maker, and there he met
and fell in love with Minnehaha.  Later in the
story, you will read of Hiawatha's wooing and of
the wedding-feast.  But before his wedding,
Hiawatha completes his first great service for his
people.  He discovers the secret of a food, Indian
corn or maize, a new gift to the Indian nations
which was to be their food for ever.
</p>

<p>
One of the most attractive of the Hiawatha
stories tells how he built his canoe.
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Give me of your bark, O Birch-Tree!<br>
  Of your yellow bark, O Birch-Tree!<br>
  Growing by the rushing river,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tall and stately in the valley!<br>
  I a light canoe will build me,<br>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P128"></a>128}</span>
  Build a swift Cheemaun for sailing,<br>
  That shall float upon the river,<br>
  Like a yellow leaf in Autumn,<br>
  Like a yellow water-lily!"<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
After this, we read in the story of how
Hiawatha slew Pearl-Feather, the greatest of
magicians, of many other deeds of Hiawatha, and
of his joys and sorrows.  Finally, the white man
comes.  Then Hiawatha is ready for his
departure; and his people greatly lament his going.
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus departed Hiawatha,<br>
  Hiawatha the Beloved,<br>
  In the glory of the sunset,<br>
  In the purple mists of evening,<br>
  To the regions of the home-wind,<br>
  Of the Northwest wind Keewaydin,<br>
  To the Islands of the Blessed,<br>
  To the kingdom of Ponemah<br>
  To the land of the Hereafter!<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
<i>Hiawatha</i>, and other stories in verse, travel
round the world in books, and boys and girls read
them in every country.  But old ballads, the
simple songs sung among the peoples of different
countries, so old that no one knows how old they
are, which we read about in Chapter seventeen,
have their own ways of travelling.  Some of these
ballads crossed the sea when the first settlers came,
and in parts of the North American continent
to-day, the old words and the old airs are sung by
descendants of the people who first brought them
across the ocean.  Two of the places where these
ballads are still sung are in North Carolina, and
in Nova Scotia where sailors and lumberjacks sing
many shanties or songs.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P129"></a>129}</span>
</p>

<p>
The most beautiful old songs, however, on this
continent are the French chansons of Quebec
which were brought over from France when the
French first came to Canada.  Now French
settlement in Canada ceased early in the eighteenth
century, so these songs must at least be as old as
the seventeenth century.  They are probably
considerably more than three hundred years old.
Various collections of the <i>chansons</i> have been
published.  Many of them are happy and romantic
songs.  One of the most beautiful is a Christmas
song.
</p>

<p>
Here is the story of the song told very briefly.
Then you will find the song printed in its own
French words.  If you do not know French well,
still you should try to make out the meaning of the
words.  No translation can give the meaning, or
the perfume, as we sometimes say, of the beautiful
old song exactly.
</p>

<p>
The singer meets a shepherd-maid and asks
where she has been.  She answers that when she
was out walking she had come by the stable, and
had seen a miracle.  What did you see? asks the
singer.  She had seen a baby lying cradled on the
straw.  Was he beautiful!  As beautiful as the
sun.  Had she seen nothing more?  Mary, his
mother, who nursed her child, and Joseph, his
father, trembling with the cold.  Nothing more?
The ox and the ass were near the stall, warming
with their breath the place where the baby lay.
Nothing more?  Three little angels coming down
from heaven singing the praises of the Father
Eternal.

CHAPTER XX
<br><br>
DANTE&mdash;CERVANTES&mdash;SPENSER
</h3>

<p>
Dante, an Italian poet, was born in Florence,
in 1265, a long time ago, and lived in
what we call the Middle Ages.  Italy then
was divided into factions who fought with each
other most of the time, and people had very
uneasy, uncomfortable lives.  Once, when Dante
was a boy, he saw a girl whose name was Beatrice
Portinari.  We do not know how often he saw
her; possibly even, they scarcely spoke to one
another.  But he never forgot Beatrice.  He
studied at more than one university, and had also
much to do with fighting.  While she was still
very young, Beatrice died.  She remained always
to Dante the loveliest and most lovable person he
had ever seen.  Dante, however, married and
had sons and daughters.
</p>

<p>
When he was little more than thirty years old,
Dante was exiled from Florence, and never returned
to his home, but led the life of a wanderer.
He had written other poems; in his exile he wrote
a very great poem called <i>The Divine Comedy</i>, or,
in Italian, <i>Divina Commedia</i>.  The idea of the
poem is to give a picture in a vision of the life that
comes after this life; and in this way to tell us
what is truly important in our present life.
</p>

<p>
Dante divided his poem into three parts.  He
called the first part Inferno, the second part
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P134"></a>134}</span>
Purgatorio, and the third part Paradiso, following
the conceptions and beliefs of his own time.
The scenery he describes is in reality Italian
scenery.  In the poem, or vision, he has two
guides, the Latin poet Virgil, whose <i>Æneid</i> is
one of the great poems of the world; and Beatrice,
who shows him the glories of Paradise.  Dante
thinks of Beatrice now as an angel in heaven, who
has grown strong and more lovely, and who
teaches and helps him in many ways.
</p>

<p>
Some day, perhaps, you will visit Italy, and if
you have not read the <i>Divine Comedy</i> before that
time, you likely will read the poem then for it
gives a true, wonderful picture of the mountainous
country of Italy.  One of the best translations
of Dante's great poem is by the Rev. H. F. Cary.
It is called <i>The Vision of Dante</i>.  Here is how
Beatrice, his guide, first appeared to Dante when
he met her in his vision in the Purgatorio:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have beheld, ere now, at break of day,<br>
  The eastern clime all roseate, and the sky<br>
  Oppos'd, one deep and beautiful serene,<br>
  And the sun's face so shaded, and with mists<br>
  Attempered at his rising, that the eye<br>
  Long while endur'd the sight: thus in a cloud<br>
  Of flowers, that from those hands angelic rose,<br>
  And down, within and outside of the car<br>
  Fell showering, in white veil with olive wreath'd,<br>
  A virgin in my view appear'd, beneath<br>
  Green mantle, rob'd in hue of living flame:<br>
  And o'er my spirit, that in former days<br>
  Within her presence had abode so long,<br>
  No shudd'ring terror crept.  Mine eyes no more<br>
  Had knowledge of her; yet there mov'd from her<br>
  A hidden virtue, at whose touch awak'd,<br>
  The power of ancient love was strong within me.<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P135"></a>135}</span>
</p>

<p>
It is possible, perhaps even it is certain, that
the first time you read these lines you will not care
for them very much.  After a while, when you
have read them several times, you likely will
begin to feel that the words express purity,
elevation, and an ethereal beauty which belong
only to our highest thoughts and feelings.  These
are qualities which are characteristic of Dante's
writings.
</p>

<p>
There is one other quotation from the <i>Divine
Comedy</i> that you may like to read before we leave
Dante's poem.  Paradiso, the third part, naturally
is the most beautiful.  Dante imagines in his
vision the blessed spirits in Paradise, singing
praises in a great choir.  This choir he sees
arrayed in many circles, one circle surrounding
another circle, like the leaves of a rose.  The lines
quoted are from the beginning of the thirty-first
canto:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  In fashion, as a snow-white rose, lay then<br>
  Before my view the saintly multitude,<br>
  Which in his own blood Christ espous'd.  Meanwhile<br>
  That other host, that soar aloft to gaze<br>
  And celebrate his glory, whom they love,<br>
  Hover'd around; and, like a troop of bees,<br>
  Amid the vernal sweets alighting now,<br>
  Now, clustering, where their fragrant labour glows,<br>
  Flew downward to the mighty flow'r, or rose<br>
  From the redundant petals, streaming back<br>
  Unto the steadfast dwelling of their joy.<br>
  Faces had they of flame, and wings of gold;<br>
  The rest was whiter than the driven snow.<br>
  And as they flitted down into the flower,<br>
  From range to range, fanning their plumy loins,<br>
  Whisper'd the peace and ardour, which they won<br>
  From that soft winnowing.  Shadow none, the vast<br>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P136"></a>136}</span>
  Interposition of such numerous flight<br>
  Cast, from above, upon the flower, or view<br>
  Obstructed aught.  For, through the universe,<br>
  Wherever merited, celestial light<br>
  Glides freely, and no obstacle prevents.<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
No, these lines are not easy to read or to understand.
But there is a fascination in reading them,
nevertheless.  We are able to lay hold of an idea,
a picture, a scene, very bright and beautiful, full
of light and glory.  When you read the lines
again, perhaps in a few months, you will find that
the picture is clearer, and that the lines will not
seem so hard to understand.  Most of us like to
remember, whether we have read the <i>Divine Comedy</i>
or not, that Dante was an Italian poet who
lived a long time ago, that he had seen and loved
Beatrice in his youth, and that later in his life
Dante made a great poem in which he tells of
Beatrice, and of life on the other side of death.
</p>

<p>
Some of you, no doubt, have played, when you
felt like it, at being knights errant.  You have
imagined that you were dressed in armour, and
that you were mounted on splendid steeds.  Then,
of course, as knights errant, you had to carry out
successfully some hard task or accomplish some
brave deed.  Once upon a time, almost exactly in
the same years during which Shakespeare was
living in England, a Spanish writer called
Cervantes wrote a book, <i>The Delightful History
of the Most Ingenious Knight Don Quixote of the
Mancha</i>, which tells how a man of fifty resolved
that he would be a knight errant.
</p>

<p>
By this time, at the beginning of the seventeenth
century, it had gone out of fashion to wear armour
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P137"></a>137}</span>
every day; and Don Quixote had a good deal of
trouble to find what he wanted.  But he owned
part of a helmet, and he made out of pasteboard
and strips of iron a contrivance to take the place
of the part that was missing.  He had a target, or
shield, and a lance.  Then he must have a steed.
He had a horse that was little more than skin and
bone.  He thought this horse would do, and he
called it Rozinante.  He wanted a lady to love and
serve.  There was a young woman who lived in a
village not far away whom he did not know very
well, but he had to have someone to call the lady
of his thoughts, so he decided she would do, and
he called her Dulcinea, since he thought that would
sound as if she were a princess or great lady.
Then after a while, he chose as his squire a
labourer who had no horse, but he had an ass, and
his name was Sancho Panza.  Don Quixote
promised Sancho that on their adventures, if he
captured an island, he would make Sancho the
governor of it; and so they set out on their
journeys.
</p>

<p>
Don Quixote was a very odd man.  He often
mistook ordinary things for wonderful marvels.
He and Sancho had not gone far when they saw
thirty or forty windmills in a field.  Don Quixote
said, Behold, here are thirty or forty monstrous
giants.  Sancho answered, no, that they were
windmills.  But Don Quixote set his lance in rest
and charged one of the giants or windmills.  He
struck the windmill.  Its arms flew round, and
gave Don Quixote and Rozinante a very bad fall.
</p>

<p>
Another day he said to Sancho that he saw a
knight coming to meet them, riding a dapple-grey
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P138"></a>138}</span>
horse, and wearing a helmet of gold on his head.
Sancho thought that he saw a man riding a grey
ass with something on his head that shone in the
sunlight.  The man proved to be the village
barber, carrying his barber's basin on his head,
and riding a grey ass as Sancho had said.  But
Don Quixote was certain that he was a knight,
and the basin really a magic helmet.  So Don
Quixote and Rozinante charged at the barber, but
he jumped off his ass and ran away.
</p>

<p>
Many other adventures of this kind befell Don
Quixote and Sancho.  If they came to an inn, Don
Quixote thought it was a castle.  Any men they
met on the road were knights, or robbers, or
under enchantment, and Don Quixote wanted
either to fight them or to rescue them.  In the
beginning of the story, Sancho thought his master
was only a very silly person.  But as time went
by, Sancho saw that he was kind, good, unselfish
and brave, although he made so many mistakes,
and Sancho came to love his master dearly.
</p>

<p>
Finally, near the end of the story, Don Quixote
thought he saw a lady in distress and meant to
rescue her.  But the lady was only an image that
some men were carrying from one place to
another.  They laughed at Don Quixote and then
they beat him until he was almost dead.  Sancho
was distracted with grief and made a great
lamentation over his master, praising him for all
his virtues.  Here is part of what Sancho said of
Don Quixote:
</p>

<p>
"O humbler of the proud, and stately to the
humbled, undertaker of perils, endurer of affronts,
enamoured without cause, imitator of good men,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P139"></a>139}</span>
whip of the evil, enemy of the wicked, and, in
conclusion, knight-errant than which no greater thing
may be said!"
</p>

<p>
After this, Don Quixote was so bruised and sick
that he and Sancho had to go home.  And so ended
Don Quixote's adventures.
</p>

<p>
Cervantes' novel was a success as soon as it
was published.  All the world laughed at Don
Quixote, but all the world loved him too.  He has
never been forgotten, or Sancho either.  A very
great many people carry about with them in their
minds a picture of a tall, lean man, in rusty
armour, riding a very thin horse, and carrying a
lance.  A short, fat man on an ass rides behind
him.  These are Don Quixote and Sancho.  Now
we know something of what it means when people
say this man or that man has been "tilting at
windmills".
</p>

<p>
An English poet, Edmund Spenser, who lived
in Queen Elizabeth's time, wrote a famous poem
called <i>The Faery Queen</i> which tells the story of
the Red Cross Knight.  After a long period of
wars and religious troubles, Spenser was the first
noted English poet, since the time of Chaucer,
to write exquisite verse.  He was the forerunner
of a greater poet who, as you know, was
Shakespeare.  We will learn some facts concerning
Chaucer's history in another chapter.
</p>

<p>
People love to read Spenser's <i>Faery Queen</i>.
The first line of the poem seems to tell how
melodious and sweet the whole poem is to be.
</p>

<p>
"A gentle knight was pricking on the plaine."  Spenser
was the first to show the music, grace,
and inexhaustible riches of the English tongue.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P140"></a>140}</span>
</p>

<p>
The Red Cross Knight had been given a hard
task.  He was to kill a fierce dragon.  In the first
book of <i>The Faery Queen</i>, Canto XI, you will
find a description of this dragon.  The Red Cross
Knight was sworn to defend Una, a beautiful
maiden, but he was deceived by enchantments, and
Una was left to wander alone in woods and on
wastes.  Here is Spenser's beautiful description
of Una:&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her angels face,<br>
  As the great eye of heaven, shyned bright,<br>
  And made a sunshine in the shadie place;<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
When Una was wandering alone in a wood, a
lion sprang at her out of a thicket.  But when the
lion saw her, he kissed her feet and licked her
hands, and after that he was her defender.
</p>

<p>
The story ends happily.  The dreadful dragon is
slain by the Red Cross Knight who finds Una
again.  But what we love most in <i>The Faery
Queen</i> is not so much the story, as the sweet and
lovely music of Spenser's wonderful lines, such
lines as you will find in Canto IX of the first book,
and also in Canto VIII of the second book.  The
second stanza of Canto VIII, second book, tells
of the angels visiting the earth to care for us.
</p>

<p class="poem">
  How oft do they their silver bowers leave<br>
  To come to succour us, that succour want,<br>
  How oft do they with golden pineons cleave<br>
  The flitting skyes, like flying pursuivant,<br>
  Against foule feendes to aide us militant:<br>
  They for us fight, they watch and dewly ward,<br>
  And their bright squadrons round about us plant;<br>
  And all for love, and nothing for reward:<br>

Would you like to have the names and dates
of some of those who are counted among the
greatest writers of the world?  Then you may
trace for yourselves how the inspiration of genius
is found from age to age in different countries.
</p>

<p>
Homer wrote about nine hundred years before
the birth of Christ.  Virgil, the Latin poet,&mdash;you
remember that both Kipling and Macaulay have
told us something of the Romans, the great
law-givers and road-builders whose language was the
Latin language,&mdash;lived and wrote from 70 B.C. to
19 B.C.  The following names and dates, you
will easily understand.

<p>
  Dante, 1265-1321.<br>
</p>

<p>
  Cervantes, 1547-1616.<br>

  Shakespeare, 1564-1616.<br>
</p>

<p>
  Goethe, 1749-1832.<br>
</p>

<p>
Johann Wolfgang Goethe was a German writer
whose most famous works are <i>Faust</i> and <i>Wilhelm
Meister</i>.  He lived at almost the same time as
Scott.  Several of the writers in the Bible belong
to the same rank as those named in this brief list.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXI
<br><br>
JOHN BUNYAN AND THE PILGRIM's PROGRESS
</h3>

<p>
The story begins in this way.
</p>

<p>
"As I walked through the wilderness of
this world, I lighted on a certain place where
was a den, and laid me down in that place to
sleep; and as I slept, I dreamed a dream.  I
dreamed, and, behold, I saw a man clothed in rags
standing in a certain place, with his face from his
own house, a book in his hand, and a great burden
upon his back."
</p>

<p>
We wonder why the man had a burden on his
back, and we wish we could help him to get rid of
it.
</p>

<p>
A man called Evangelist met the man with a
burden on his back.  Evangelist pointed out to the
man a wicket-gate, and asked him if he could see
a shining light.  When the man answered that he
did, Evangelist told him to go straight to the gate
and knock at it.  Then he would be told what he
was to do.  Now the man's name was Christian.
</p>

<p>
On the way to the gate, he fell into a muddy
bog which was called the Slough of Despond.
Then a man called Help came and pulled him out.
After that, Mr. Worldly-Wiseman told him not to
go to the gate, but to a village where Mr. Legality
lived.  Christian turned aside from his way, and
presently came to some rocks which hung over so
far he was afraid they would fall on him, and fire
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P143"></a>143}</span>
came out of the rocks and he was very much
afraid.  But Evangelist found him again and set
him on the right way.  Then Christian came to
the gate and knocked.
</p>

<p>
A man answered his knock and showed him how
to go to the house of the Interpreter.  There he
saw many wonderful things which you must read
about in <i>The Pilgrim's Progress</i>.  Not long after
Christian left the house of the Interpreter, he
came to a place where there was a Cross and there
his burden fell off.
</p>

<p>
After that he came to the Hill Difficulty, which
was so steep that sometimes he had to clamber
up on his hands and knees.  He got up the hill;
then he remembered that he had been told he
would meet two lions.  He went on his way feeling
very despondent, but presently he looked up and
saw a stately palace called Beautiful, so he
hastened to get to it.
</p>

<p>
He came first to a lodge, and there was a porter
in the lodge who helped him past the lions.  After
all, the lions were chained, but it was a narrow
place and they might have caught Christian if the
porter had not helped him.
</p>

<p>
Christian had a very happy holiday in the
House Beautiful, and there he made many friends.
Before he left to continue his journey, they
showed him on a clear day the Delectable
Mountains from which one can see the gate of the
Celestial City.  The Celestial City was to be the
end of Christian's pilgrimage.  After that he met
another pilgrim called Faithful, and he was not
alone any more.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P144"></a>144}</span>
</p>

<p>
After a little while, Christian and Faithful
came to the Valley of Humiliation, and met in it
a terrible monster called Apollyon.  He had scales
like a fish, wings like a dragon, feet like a bear,
and a mouth like the mouth of a lion.  Christian
fought Apollyon.  Apollyon wounded Christian,
and knocked his sword out of his hand.  But
Christian caught his sword again and gave
Apollyon a great wound.  "And, with that,
Apollyon spread forth his dragon's wings, and
sped him away, so that Christian saw him no
more."
</p>

<p>
Then Faithful and Christian came to a town
called Vanity, where the people had a fair called
Vanity Fair.  In this town with the great fair,
Faithful and Christian were arrested, because of
their religion.  They were tried by a judge and
jury, and Faithful was put to death.  Christian
was put back into prison, but he escaped.  And
after that he had another companion on his
pilgrimage who was called Hopeful.
</p>

<p>
They came to a river and a beautiful meadow.
But they lost their way and when they were
asleep, Giant Despair of Doubting-castle found
them and put them into a dungeon.  Hopeful
encouraged Christian, but they had a very sad time
in the dungeon, until Christian suddenly
remembered that he had a key which he had been
told would open any lock in Doubting-castle.
And so they escaped.
</p>

<p>
Now they came to the Delectable Mountains,
and there they met shepherds who entertained
them.  From there they went on, and began to
feel that they were drawing near the end of their
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P145"></a>145}</span>
journey.  They passed through the Enchanted
Ground with some difficulty, and came to the
country of Beulah whose air is very sweet and
pleasant, and there they met some of the
inhabitants of the Celestial City.
</p>

<p>
They could see the City, which was glorious.
But before they could get to it, they had to cross
a river.  Hopeful helped Christian.  "Christian
therefore presently found ground to stand upon,
and so it followed that the rest of the river was
but shallow, thus they got over."  After that,
they had no more difficulty.  But shining ones
came to meet them, and trumpeters who welcomed
them with shouting and sound of trumpet.
</p>

<p>
"This done, they compassed them round on
every side, some went before, some behind, and
some on the right hand, some on the left, (as it
were to guard them through the upper regions),
continually sounding as they went, with melodious
noise, in notes on high; so that the very sight
was to them that could behold it as if heaven
itself were come down to meet them.  Thus,
therefore, they walked on together; and, as they
walked, ever and anon these trumpeters, even
with joyful sound, would, by mixing their music
with looks and gestures, still signify to Christian
and his brother how welcome they were into their
company, and with what gladness they came to
meet them.  And now were these two men, as it
were, in heaven, before they came at it, being
swallowed up with the sight of angels, and with
hearing their melodious notes.  Here also they
had the City itself in view; and they thought they
heard all the bells therein to ring, to welcome
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P146"></a>146}</span>
them thereto.  But, above all, the warm and
joyful thoughts that they had about their own
dwelling there, with such company, and that for ever
and ever; oh! by what tongue, or pen, can their
glorious joy be expressed!  Thus they came up
to the gate."
</p>

<p>
A second part of The Pilgrim's Progress tells
how Christiana, Christian's wife, and their
children, and Mercy, a friend, went on the same
pilgrimage, with Mr. Great-heart to take care of
them.  Mr. Great-heart is one of the most
splendid heroes in any book.
</p>

<p>
John Bunyan, who wrote <i>The Pilgrim's Progress</i>,
was the son of a tinker.  He was himself
a tinker.  He was a soldier in Cromwell's army,
and then he was a preacher.  Only certain
people were allowed to preach at that time, and they
arrested Bunyan.  He was in prison a number
of years.  They were willing to let him out, but
he would not promise not to preach.  Brave John
Bunyan!  He had a brave wife too, who did all
she could to help him.
</p>

<p>
He was sentenced to prison twice, the second
time only for a few months when he was kept in
the gaol in Bedford town in England.  Bunyan
wrote <i>The Pilgrim's Progress</i> in a room in Bedford
gaol which is built on the bridge that crosses
the river Ouse, and while he wrote he could hear
the noise of the river flowing by.  Perhaps this
is one reason why he writes so beautifully of
rivers in the story.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXII
<br><br>
THACKERAY&mdash;MEREDITH&mdash;HARDY
</h3>

<p>
You remember David Copperfield, Peggoty,
Mr. Pickwick, Sam Weller, and scores of
others, all of whom we found living so
intensely and abundantly in Dickens' novels.
</p>

<p>
Many other novelists, as well as Charles Dickens,
have made interesting, delightful characters
for us to know and love.  In this chapter and the
chapter following, we will learn something of a
group of writers, men and women, in whose novels
we find wonderful knowledge of human nature,
not as wonderful as Shakespeare's knowledge
perhaps, but showing the same deep insight
as Scott and Dickens.
</p>

<p>
The writers spoken of are not very widely
separated in time.  Two of them lived and wrote as
recently as from the middle of the nineteenth
century down to the present.  George Meredith died
in 1909, and Thomas Hardy in 1928.  The whole
group represents a very brilliant period in
English literature.
</p>

<p>
William Makepeace Thackeray was born in
Calcutta in India.  Like the children of other
Anglo-Indian civil servants, he was sent home to
England when he was a very little boy, leaving
his mother behind him in India.  Thackeray had
a deeply affectionate nature.  All his life he was
devoted to his own people.  No one can rightly
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P148"></a>148}</span>
understand his novels who does not remember
that Thackeray was tender-hearted.  We can
read a letter that the little boy William
Makepeace wrote to his mother when he was seven
years old.  His mother kept it carefully.  Some
years ago when his daughter, Mrs. Ritchie,
herself a novelist, was writing memories of her
famous father, she printed the little letter in her
Introduction to <i>The Newcomes</i>.
</p>

<p>
There is nothing in the letter to show that the
boy was to be a great writer, but as long as he
lived he wrote these loving letters to his mother.
When he was a man with children of his own, his
home was his mother's home whenever she liked
to come to stay with him.  It was his stepfather's
home also, for his mother had married again.
He told his own children that when he was a boy
at school, he sometimes used to pray that he
would dream of his mother in the night, for he
was lonely and not very happy.
</p>

<p>
<i>Vanity Fair</i> is the name of one of Thackeray's
great novels.  You know where Thackeray found
the name,&mdash;in <i>The Pilgrim's Progress</i>.  His
novel is intended as a picture of people who are
interesting and very real, but many of whom are
selfish, false and hard-hearted.  Thackeray
painted the world as he had experienced it, and
he tried to show what a difference there is
between love and hate, selfishness and unselfishness.
<i>Vanity Fair</i> has a famous opening chapter.  Becky
Sharp, and Amelia Sedley, two girls, are leaving
a boarding school.  Becky is clever, amusing and
poor.  Amelia is gentle, a little dull perhaps, and
her people are rich.  The school-mistresses make
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P149"></a>149}</span>
a great fuss over Amelia, but are disagreeable to
Becky.  So Becky throws the dictionary, which is
Miss Pinkerton's parting gift, out of the window
of the coach as they are driving away.  <i>Vanity
Fair</i> is a famous novel.  When you read it,
as you will some day, you will learn the story of
Becky and Amelia, of George Osborne whom
Amelia marries, of Jos. Sedley, Amelia's brother,
of Rawdon Crawley, the man Becky married, and
of splendid, faithful Major Dobbin.  There are
chapters which tell of how George Osborne goes
to fight at the battle of Waterloo, and again of
when the battle is over, that we can never forget.
Thackeray's style is so golden and perfect that
to read anything he has written is like listening
to strains of pure music.
</p>

<p>
Other novels by Thackeray which rank with
<i>Vanity Fair</i> are <i>Esmond</i> and <i>The Virginians</i>,
<i>Pendennis</i> and <i>The Newcomes</i>.  One of the most
famous characters in <i>Esmond</i> is the exquisitely
beautiful Beatrix Esmond who turned away from
love for ambition.  Colonel Newcome in <i>The
Newcomes</i> is one of the people who have been
chosen by the world to represent nobility of
character, a man high-minded, distinguished, brave,
honest, pure and humble of heart.
</p>

<p>
There are scenes of great tenderness and
nobility in Thackeray's novels.  Two, which may
be mentioned, are in Esmond&mdash;Lady Castlewood
welcoming Henry Esmond home, Book II, chapter
six, and again Lady Castlewood vindicating
Esmond, Book III, chapter four.  Find <i>Esmond</i>
and read these chapters or ask someone to read
them to you.  When Thackeray tells in <i>Vanity
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P150"></a>150}</span>
Fair</i> how George Osborne lies with his face to
the sky after Waterloo, every reader's heart is
stilled and touched.  But many people think that
the most famous instance of Thackeray's genius
is in the end of <i>The Newcomes</i> when Colonel
Newcome, impoverished, living in Grey Friars
Hospital, thinks that he is a boy at school again, and
answers the calling of the roll after the fashion
in his old school at Charterhouse.
</p>

<p>
Several biographies have been written of
Thackeray, but you will find the most interesting
details of the life of this great writer in the
biographical notes written by his daughter,
Mrs. Ritchie, for what is called the Biographical
Edition of Thackeray's works.
</p>

<p>
Meredith, unlike Thackeray, writes in a style
which is difficult to read; but he is brilliant,
sparkling, and wonderfully clever.  We need to bring
to his novels all the intelligence and powers of
application which we possess.  But when
difficulties are overcome, there is great delight
in reading Meredith.  He is never dull.  There
is always meaning, like precious gold, to find in
his novels, and in his poems too, for Meredith
was a poet.  Meredith shows us that our minds,
characters and wills have a conquering quality;
we are not at the mercy of impulses, instincts and
intuitions.  Not since Shakespeare wrote, has
any genius drawn such portraits of women as
appear in Meredith's novels.  Three of his most
brilliant and fascinating women characters are
Diana in <i>Diana of the Crossways</i>, Clara Middleton
and Laetitia Dale in <i>The Egoist</i>.  There is
also in <i>The Egoist</i> a splendidly drawn portrait
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P151"></a>151}</span>
of a boy, Crossjay Patterne.  This boy and the
beautiful, high-minded Clara Middleton are
friends and playmates; it is quite possible for
a boy or a girl to have a grown-up friend, who
is at the same time a playmate.
</p>

<p>
<i>Diana of the Crossways</i> and <i>The Egoist</i> are
perhaps the most readable among the many
novels Meredith has written.  Sir Willoughby
Patterne in <i>The Egoist</i> is a study of a man whose
interests are centered in himself.  Diana is
charming, brilliant, impulsive, and of a noble
nature.  She is a very attractive heroine.
</p>

<p>
Thomas Hardy was born in 1840, in a tiny
village called Higher Bockhampton, in the parish of
Stinsford, Dorset, England.  It is a country of
woods and heaths, lonely and silent.  Old
customs and manners were maintained in this place
in the heart of England, long after they had
disappeared in more populous centres.  Hardy's
novels tell us of the quaint customs, and of the
interesting and picturesque characters that he
knew in his youth.  Three of his early novels,
<i>Under the Greenwood Tree</i>, <i>The Return of the
Native</i>, and <i>The Trumpet-Major</i> seem to hold
under a magic spell, for our enjoyment, old England
and the people of old England, not at a time as
long ago as when the fairies were supposed to
live, but near the beginning of the nineteenth
century, when people were looking for Napoleon
Bonaparte to invade England from France across
the Channel.
</p>

<p>
Hardy himself, his father and his grandfather
were all fond of music, and we read much of
people singing and dancing in Hardy's early novels,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P152"></a>152}</span>
of the members of the church choir, of glee and
carol singers.  Thomas Hardy, when he was a
lad, used to play the fiddle at dances in the farm
houses nearby where he lived.  His mother did
not allow him to take any money for his playing,
but once he broke the rule and with the few
shillings he had been given bought a copy of the
<i>Boys' Own Book</i>.  This book was kept in Hardy's
library all his life.  He played at weddings too.
No doubt, the boy learned much of his neighbours
in this way of which afterwards his genius made
use in his novels.
</p>

<p>
Some of the most charming scenes that Hardy
ever wrote you will find in the first five chapters
of <i>Under the Greenwood Tree</i>.  Read these
chapters, and you will see the English landscape long
ago on a Christmas Eve.  You will breathe the
pure, chill air, and sing Christmas carols with the
other carollers.  The story begins: "To dwellers
in a wood almost every species of tree has its
voice as well as its feature."
</p>

<p>
To the end of his life, Hardy was fascinated by
the story of Napoleon.  In the country where he
lived, there lived also older men who had fought
against Napoleon, and many who remembered the
dread with which people looked for his invasion of
England.  One of Hardy's early novels, <i>The
Trumpet-Major</i>, is a fine tale of country folk, of
soldiers and sailors who fought against Napoleon,
and of the press-gang that carried away men to
serve in the Navy.  But, proudest recollection of
all for the novelist, the Hardy who held the great
Nelson in his arms when he lay dying victorious
in the cockpit of his ship, <i>The Victory</i>, after
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P153"></a>153}</span>
Trafalgar, belonged to the same family as his
own.  You remember, Nelson whispered, "Kiss
me, Hardy."
</p>

<p>
Little wonder that Thomas Hardy, who also
was a poet besides being a novelist, wrote what
is perhaps his greatest work in a poetical drama
called <i>The Dynasts</i>, a drama of the Napoleonic
wars.
</p>

<p>
This poetical drama is a great vision of war,
of suffering, brave, stout-hearted, jesting men,
and of mighty spirits who from some vast height
view the battling world, and wonder what the
future of mankind may be.  Such lines as the
following stay in our memories and convince us that
Thomas Hardy was not only a great novelist, but
a great poet.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXIII
<br><br>
JANE AUSTEN&mdash;GEORGE ELIOT&mdash;THE BRONTES
</h3>

<p>
Jane Austen is very much like herself, and
like no one else.  Most of us find people of
this description interesting.  It is true, that
the more we know of Miss Austen, the more
interesting we find her.
</p>

<p>
The characters in her novels are so real that no
one has ever been able to find any fault with the
way in which she created them.
</p>

<p>
Is it possible for us to discover how it was that
she made her characters so real?  Mr. Woodhouse
is one of the people in Miss Austen's novel
called <i>Emma</i>.  Emma is Mr. Woodhouse's daughter.
He is rather an invalid; at least, he thinks
he is an invalid.  Emma is a kind, good-hearted,
managing young lady, who takes good care of her
father, and who, since Mr. Woodhouse does not
want to be troubled about anything, has all the
responsibility of a large household.  This
arrangement suits Emma perfectly.
</p>

<p>
Emma often arranges a little tea party to
amuse her father.  He likes company, and quiet,
sociable conversation.  He wants his guests to
eat, but he is afraid that what they eat will not
be good for them.  On one occasion, Emma had
provided minced chicken and scalloped oysters,
for their guests.  Her father would take only a
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P155"></a>155}</span>
little thin gruel.  Poor Mr. Woodhouse urges the
ladies to partake of his hospitality in this
fashion.
</p>

<p>
"Mrs. Bates, let me propose your venturing on
one of these eggs.  An egg boiled very soft is
not unwholesome.  Serle understands boiling an
egg better than anybody.  I would not recommend
an egg boiled by anybody else,&mdash;but you
need not be afraid, they are very small, you
see&mdash;one of our small eggs will not hurt you.  Miss
Bates, let Emma help you to a little bit of tart,&mdash;a
very little bit.  Ours are all apple tarts.  You
need not be afraid of unwholesome preserves
here.  I do not advise the custard.  Mrs. Goddard,
what say you to half a glass of wine,&mdash;a
small half-glass, put into a tumbler of water?
I do not think it could disagree with you."
</p>

<p>
But Emma took care that their guests had
plenty to eat.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Woodhouse also was very particular about
his horses.  He kept horses and a coachman, but
he seldom thought that the horses ought to be
taken out.
</p>

<p>
With delicate, true touches such as these, and
in easy conversation, Miss Austen builds up her
characters.  By the time we have finished the
story, we know Mr. Woodhouse intimately, and
Emma, and Mrs. and Miss Bates, Mr. Knightley,
and many others.  Is it not true that you know a
good deal about Mr. Woodhouse only from hearing
him speak of what food his guests should eat?
</p>

<p>
Mr. Bennet in <i>Pride and Prejudice</i> is a father
of a different character.  He has five daughters,
but he is fondest of Elizabeth, or Eliza as she is
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P156"></a>156}</span>
often called.  Mrs. Bennet, his wife, is unfortunately
rather a silly person.  Miss Austen is able
to explain Mrs. Bennet's character just by letting
her talk, and Mrs. Bennet talks a great deal.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Bennet says to her husband, for instance,
that he has no compassion on her poor nerves.
Mr. Bennet answers: "You mistake me, my dear.
I have a high respect for your nerves.  They are
my old friends.  I have heard you mention them
with consideration these twenty years at least."
</p>

<p>
One would say that Mr. Bennet was, perhaps,
not very considerate himself, a little inclined to
be satirical with his foolish wife.  But here is
part of a conversation of his with Eliza, when
she has told him at the end of the second book
that she was going to be married, which shows
Mr. Bennet in a better light.
</p>

<p>
"Well, my dear," said he, when she ceased
speaking, "I have no more to say.  If this be the
case, he deserves you.  I could not have parted
with you, my Lizzy, to any one less worthy."
</p>

<p>
How easy and simple it all seems, and yet to
write naturally and simply, with such entire truth
to nature, is one of the most difficult arts for any
novelist.
</p>

<p>
Miss Austen wrote six novels altogether, <i>Pride
and Prejudice</i>, <i>Sense and Sensibility</i>, <i>Emma</i>,
<i>Persuasion</i>, <i>Mansfield Park</i>, and <i>Northanger Abbey</i>.
She lived and wrote a little more than a hundred
years ago, but her books are read and admired
to-day perhaps more than at any previous time.
There is something very charming and interesting
in Miss Austen's reticence, truthfulness,
strength of character, crystal purity and delightful
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P157"></a>157}</span>
humour.  Her field is narrow, she is not
eloquent or sublime, but her work in its own way is
perfect.
</p>

<p>
When Miss Austen wrote, it was not the fashion
for ladies to write, and she often used to hide
her manuscript beneath a bit of sewing, or place
it hastily in a drawer when a door near where
she wrote creaked on its hinges.  We know from
some letters written by her family that there was
such a creaking door.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Kipling has written a poem in praise of
Jane Austen which you will find in his book called
<i>Debits and Credits</i>.  He pictures Miss Austen
being met at heaven's gate by some of the great
novelists: Good Sir Walter, you know who that
is; Henry, this is a great English novelist whose
name was Henry Fielding; Tobias, another English
novelist, Tobias Smollett; Miguel of Spain,
this is Cervantes.  From this short poem you
can judge how highly other writers rank Jane
Austen.
</p>

<p>
Tom and Maggie Tulliver are brother and
sister.  They appear in George Eliot's novel <i>The
Mill on the Floss</i>.  Tom and Maggie serve,
perhaps, as the best known instance in fiction of a
study of the relations between brother and sister.
Certainly, we often think of Tom and Maggie,
and always we think of them as boy and girl,
brother and sister.
</p>

<p>
Tom is very much of a boy.  He is an important
person in the family, and he is to succeed
his father at Dorlcote Mill, which is on the river
Floss.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P158"></a>158}</span>
</p>

<p>
Is not this a beautiful description of Dorlcote
Mill?  George Eliot must have been writing of
a mill that she knew and loved:
</p>

<p>
"And this is Dorlcote Mill.  I must stand a
minute or two here on the bridge and look at it,
though the clouds are threatening, and it is far
on in the afternoon.  Even in this leafless time
of departing February it is pleasant to look
at,&mdash;perhaps the chill damp season adds a charm to
the trimly kept comfortable dwelling-house, as
old as the elms and chestnuts that shelter it from
the northern blast.  The stream is brimful now,
and lies high in this little withy plantation, and
half drowns the grassy fringe of the croft in front
of the house.  As I look at the full stream, the
vivid grass, the delicate bright-green powder
softening the outline of the great trunks and
branches that gleam from under the bare purple
boughs, I am in love with moistness, and envy
the white ducks that are dipping their heads far
into the water here among the withes, unmindful
of the awkward appearance they make in the
drier world above."
</p>

<p>
Maggie Tulliver is a wonderful study of a girl,
later of a young woman.  No one surely can help
loving Maggie, who adored Tom with all her
heart, who was often in disgrace with her mother,
as for instance, when she cut off her hair, who
spent a great part of her time reading books, and
who was her father's favourite.  Tom was rather
hard on Maggie.  When they grew up there was
a sad time when Tom refused to have anything
to do with her.  Yet Maggie always loved Tom
best.  At the end of the story, there is a flood.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P159"></a>159}</span>
The river rises so high that everyone's life is in
danger.  And Maggie comes alone by herself in
a boat to rescue Tom.
</p>

<p>
It is probable, indeed it is certain, that George
Eliot was writing of her own girlhood, and of her
feelings for her brother, when she created with
the power of genius Maggie Tulliver.  Such
depth of understanding, tenderness, and
poignancy of feeling, are only possible when one
knows people very, very well.  George Eliot knew
Maggie Tulliver perfectly.
</p>

<p>
George Eliot, of course, is only a pen name.
The author's real name was Mary Ann Evans.
She lived in the country, like the Tullivers, and
her many novels abound with striking characters
among country people.  One of the most successful
of them is Mrs. Poyser in the novel <i>Adam
Bede</i>.  Mrs. Poyser is famous for her clever sayings,
full of pithy truth and wit.  It was she who
said of some one for whom she did not care,
that it was a pity he could not be hatched over
again and hatched different.  Sayings of this
kind generally are spoken by clever people
who are not educated, as most of us understand
education, but who have learned a great
deal about life and human nature.  This power
of inventing wise, amusing sayings is called
mother wit.
</p>

<p>
George Eliot was a learned woman, and spent
her later life in London.  But her country books
are probably her best.  She wrote a little later
than Jane Austen, and some time before Hardy.
Another of her stories that you are likely to
enjoy is <i>Silas Marner</i>.  Others, besides <i>The Mill on
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P160"></a>160}</span>
the Floss</i>, and <i>Adam Bede</i>, are <i>Romola</i>, <i>Felix
Holt</i>, <i>Middlemarch</i>, and <i>Daniel Deronda</i>.
</p>

<p>
We come now to the story of two of the most
romantic figures in English literature.  Early
in the nineteenth century, a clergyman who was
of Irish descent and whose name was Patrick
Brontë, had a family of children most of whom
were remarkably gifted.  Those whom we know
best are Charlotte, Emily, Anne, and a brother
Branwell, who was born after Charlotte and
before Emily.  Branwell might have been an artist,
but his life was not successful or happy.  Anne
wrote pleasing stories, but Charlotte and Emily
Brontë are sisters whom we associate with an
atmosphere of strange romance and rich endowment.
</p>

<p>
Most of their lives was spent in Yorkshire,
amidst wild and romantic scenery.  They were
poor and had few possessions.  Charlotte was a
governess.  She studied in Brussels in Belgium,
and her younger sister Emily was with her.
Charlotte was influenced by French literature, Emily
by all that was strange and mysterious in German
literature.  Charlotte's best known book is
<i>Jane Eyre</i>.  Emily's masterpiece is <i>Wuthering
Heights</i>.  Wuthering Heights means a high place
where great winds blow most of the time.
</p>

<p>
<i>Jane Eyre</i> is a romantic, extravagant story of
a girl who was a governess, and of the strange
people she met.  The story is not even always
well-written; yet it is exciting and thrilling.
Few novels had such depth of feeling, passion
and elevated thought.  No one can read Charlotte
Brontë's novels without tingling with a
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P161"></a>161}</span>
feeling that here one has met an extraordinary
personality.
</p>

<p>
Emily Brontë was more highly gifted even than
her sister Charlotte.  Everything that is true of
<i>Jane Eyre</i> is more true of <i>Wuthering Heights</i>.  It
is a stranger, and more romantic story.  At times,
one would even say that there is something hard
and cruel in <i>Wuthering Heights</i>.  But there is also
natural genius.  Emily wrote a few remarkable
poems which are more highly esteemed now than
they were when she died.  One does not say that
these two sisters were possessed of the highest
creative power.  But Charlotte and Emily Brontë
are among the most interesting and unforgettable
of English novelists.  Barrie said not long ago of
Emily Brontë that she was our greatest woman,
meaning that he believed her to be the greatest
among English-speaking women writers.  This
sense of greatness you will experience for
yourselves in the words which end <i>Wuthering Heights</i>.
The story is tragic; but the ending is happy and
tranquil, although at first it may seem sad.
</p>

<p>
"I lingered round them, under that benign
sky: watched the moths fluttering among the
heath and harebells, listened to the soft wind
breathing through the grass, and wondered how
anyone could ever imagine unquiet slumbers for
the sleepers in that quiet earth."

<h3>
CHAPTER XXIV
<br><br>
WHAT IS HISTORY!
</h3>

<p>
Most of us like true stories.  Often, when
we listen to a story which seems interesting
and surprising, perhaps even delightful,
we say when the story is ended, "But, is it
true?"  If the answer is no, or even that the
story is not all true, we are disappointed.
</p>

<p>
This feeling of wishing to know the truth about
people and events, about what the world is really
like and what it used to be like, belongs to human
nature.  It is born in our hearts when we are
born.  From the beginning of the world, people
have cared for true stories.
</p>

<p>
As you know, knowledge of remarkable events
and people at first was repeated by one generation
to another by word of mouth.  But tradition,
although interesting, is often inaccurate.  It does
not tell the whole, exact true story.  So people
were willing to spend a great deal of time, and to
work very hard, to find out the truth about past
events and about people who lived in the past.
</p>

<p>
In this way was born the art and science of
history.  History is a science, because writing
true history requires careful, painstaking,
unwearied research.  Writing history is also an
art, since to make events and human beings of
long ago, or even of yesterday and to-day, live
in a book in such a way that we can understand
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P166"></a>166}</span>
them, and read of them with interest and enjoyment,
requires imagination and all other gifts
which are needed to write true histories, or true
stories.
</p>

<p>
Herodotus, a Greek, who lived four hundred
and eighty-four years before the birth of Christ,
is called the father of history.  He is a model, or
pattern, still for historians.  He was not only
the first great historian, he is one of the greatest
among writers of history.  When he wrote history
first, he used to recite what he had composed to
his friends.  At one of these recitals of history
by Herodotus, a boy was present with his father.
The boy's name was Thucydides.  He was so
charmed and excited by what Herodotus said that
he burst into tears, as we do sometimes when
we are greatly moved by a beautiful thing.
Thucydides afterwards, when he grew up, became
a great historian.
</p>

<p>
In another chapter, we shall try to learn of
some interesting modern histories, and some
famous modern historians,&mdash;modern, that is, as
compared with Herodotus and Thucydides.  But
many of the books that we have read for other
reasons have told us a good deal about people
who lived long ago, and of their customs.
</p>

<p>
You remember the ballads of "Chevy Chase"
and "The Battle of Otterbourne", which tell how
the English and Scots fought with one another.
These ballads are not accurate history, but they
are undoubtedly historical.  They take us, with
a strange, thrilling feeling that we can almost
see what must have happened, as far back as
1388.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P167"></a>167}</span>
</p>

<p>
At the time when Queen Philippa of Hainault
was the wife of King Edward III of England, a
young Hainaulter, a fellow countryman of hers,
came from France to visit her and brought with
him a copy of a book of chronicles, written by
himself about recent wars in France.  His name
was Sir John Froissart.  He was eager to write
true histories of his own time, medieval histories
as we call them.  You will find Sir John Froissart's
<i>Chronicles</i> a delightful book to read.  Many
of the stories which Froissart first wrote are in
the histories we read to-day.  Queen Philippa was
greatly pleased with the visit of her young
fellow-countryman and with his book.  Froissart stayed
in England for some time, and while he was
there found out everything he could about the
Battle of Otterbourne.  The story is told in one
of his chronicles.
</p>

<p>
Here are two short extracts from the chronicle
of the Battle of Otterbourne.  Froissart wrote in
old French.  His chronicles were translated into
English by Lord Berners in the time of King
Henry VIII.  In these extracts the old English
spelling has been modernized.
</p>

<p>
"At the beginning the Englishmen were so
strong that they reculed back their enemies: then
the Earl Douglas, who was of great heart and high
of enterprise, seeing his men recule back, then to
recover the place and to shew knightly valour,
he took his axe in both his hands, and entered
so into the press that he made himself way in
such wise that none durst approach near him,
and he was so well armed that he bare well off
such strokes as he received.  Thus he went ever
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P168"></a>168}</span>
forward like a hardy Hector, willing alone to
conquer the field and to discomfit his enemies:
but at last he was encountered with three spears
all at once, so that he was borne perforce to the
earth and after that he could not be again
relieved.  Some of his knights and squires followed
him, but not all, for it was night, and no light but
by the shining of the moon..."
</p>

<p>
"This battle was fierce and cruel till it came
to the end of the discomfiture; but when the Scots
saw the Englishmen recule and yield themselves,
then the Scots were courteous and set them to
their ransom, and every man said to his prisoner:
Sirs, go and unarm you and take your ease: I
am your master': and so made their prisoners as
good cheer as though they had been brethren,
without doing to them any damage."
</p>

<p>
You will notice that part of the battle must
have been fought at night, for the moon was shining.
It is likely that Froissart was told this story
by some man who had been at the battle and
remembered well that there was no light but the
light of the moon.  The direct account of an
eyewitness is one of the most convincing forms of
true history.  If you will turn to the Acts of the
Apostles, you can read in the twenty-fifth and
twenty-sixth chapters another account by an
eyewitness, telling how Paul, after he had been kept
in prison two years, was sent for by a new
governor Festus, and of the speech he made to
Festus, and to King Agrippa and Queen Bernice.
As you know, some books of the Bible are histories.
This splendid account of an old trial is
a fine example of historical writing.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P169"></a>169}</span>
</p>

<p>
Old books, old manuscripts, inscriptions,
records of all kinds, old and new, even buried
cities, form part of the material which historians
study.  A historian may find that the same event
is related in one manuscript after one fashion,
and in another manuscript in quite a different
way.  So it is that historians always want to
find corroboration, if possible, for facts which
they wish to use in their histories.  Thus we see
that the work of a historian is difficult.  But
anyone who writes a history which is true, and
well authenticated, and interesting to read, has
served mankind well.  He has increased our
knowledge and understanding, and in this way
has made those who read his history more useful
and capable men and women.
</p>

<p>
Let us take one or two of the easiest and most
attractive books that a historian might wish to
consult, and see if we can find in them any facts,
or pictures, which might be useful in writing a
true history.
</p>

<p>
Long ago, in the latter part of the fourteenth
century, there lived an English poet whose name
was Geoffrey Chaucer.  He wrote a poem called
<i>The Canterbury Tales</i> which tells of a number
of people who were going as pilgrims to a shrine
in the great Cathedral at Canterbury.  They met
in the Tabard Inn in Southwark at London.
Chaucer describes these people one by one so
accurately that we can learn how people looked,
and what they wore, these many hundred years
ago.  He tells, too, of the landlord or host who
kept the Inn.  His name was Harry Bayly.  It
seems from other records in the Public Record
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P170"></a>170}</span>
Office in London that the landlord of the Tabard
Inn at the time actually was a Harry Bayly.
Chaucer, as well as being a poet, had a post in
the Custom House.  There is a record of Harry
Bayly paying money into the Customs.  It seems
certain that Chaucer's descriptions of the Canterbury
pilgrims are true and accurate pictures of
people who lived in his time.
</p>

<p>
Who were these people?
</p>

<p>
"A knyght ther was, and that a worthy man,"&mdash;Later
Chaucer says of him that:
</p>

<p>
"He was a verray parfit gentil knyght."  His
son was there, a young squire, and among the
other pilgrims were a yeoman, a nun, a prioress,
a monk, a friar, a merchant, a clerk, a sergeant
at law, a franklin, a haberdasher, a carpenter,
a cook, a shipman or sailor, a doctor, a goodwife,
a ploughman, a reeve, a pardoner, and several
others.
</p>

<p>
The squire "was as fressh as in the monthe of
May."  The prioress was very good-looking.
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Hire nose tretys, hir eyen greye as glas,<br>
  Hir mouth ful smal and ther-to softe and reed,<br>
  But sikely she hadde a fair forheed.<br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
These words are easily changed into our modern
spelling.  The last line, for instance is
</p>

<p>
  "But certainly she had a fair forehead."<br>
</p>

<p>
Chaucer describes exactly the way in which each
one was dressed.  Then each of the pilgrims tells
a story, and in these stories we find more information
of how people looked and how they lived
in the fourteenth century.  Chaucer's poetry,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P171"></a>171}</span>
although somewhat difficult to read on account of
the old words, is fresh and beautiful still.
</p>

<p>
Shakespeare's plays, especially his historical
plays, throw a wonderful light on the battles, life
and customs of England at the time of Agincourt,
in the Wars of the Roses, and his own lifetime.
Besides the beauty and greatness of his plays,
Shakespeare added always to whatever he wrote
his wonderful true knowledge of human nature.
Turn to Act iii, Scene ii of <i>King Henry V</i>, and
you will read what a boy, serving some of the
soldiers, says in all the tumult and excitement of
the battle.
</p>

<p>
"Would I were in an alehouse in London!  I
would give all my fame for a pot of ale and
safety."
</p>

<p>
One of the most important subjects of which
many historians write is politics.  Charles Dickens,
as you know, was a humorist.  In his stories, he
describes social conditions which existed in the
early part of the nineteenth century and which
later have been somewhat improved.  Dickens,
possibly, exaggerated a little, and made his
accounts somewhat of a burlesque of what actually
existed.  Yet when we want to read a true and
very amusing account of an election, which might
be of use to political historians when they write
of the earlier part of the nineteenth century,
we will find it in chapter thirteen of <i>Pickwick
Papers</i>.
</p>

<p>
The town of Eatanswill is the scene of the
election.  Mr. Pickwick, Mr. Tupman, Mr. Snodgrass,
Mr. Winkle, and Sam Weller are in Eatanswill,
and take a lively part in the proceedings.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P172"></a>172}</span>
Dickens, as you know, helped to laugh away many
abuses.  Elections are not carried on in the same
way to-day.  But the political candidates and
newspapers of Eatanswill, what they said, did,
and printed, make an amusing story which has
at the same time not a little historical truth.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Now we know a very little of how historians
try to find out the truth about what has happened
in the past, so that they may write true histories.
Very long ago, people used to believe that each
art had its own muse, a beautiful being like a
goddess, who helped and guided followers of her
art.  They called the muse of history Clio.  So
if it pleases us to do so, we can think of the
beautiful spirit, or muse, of history teaching,
entertaining and helping us all.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXV
<br><br>
THE MEANING OF POLITICS
</h3>

<p>
We may learn from games a good deal of
the nature of politics.
</p>

<p>
We know that the better the game is
organized, the better it will be played.  In many
games, there are two sides, two captains, and an
equal number of players on each side.  Captains
have duties, players have duties.  Captains
should be able to think quickly, understand quickly,
make quick decisions, and not make mistakes
any oftener than they can help.  They should
understand other boys.  Or if the game is played
by girls, the girl who is captain should
understand other girls.  Players ought to be willing
to obey the captain's word.  Some day, the player
may be the captain; perhaps he has been a
captain already.  The whole team, players and
captain, should be loyal.  A game cannot be
altogether successful unless it is played with good
feeling, generosity, keenness, sportsmanship and
honour on both sides.  Each side should be on
good terms with the other side and behave with
courtesy.  These things are true in games.  They
are true also in politics, although, possibly, not
quite in the same way.
</p>

<p>
As soon as people began to live together in
communities, some of the people wanted the
community properly organized and governed.  They
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P174"></a>174}</span>
thought everything belonging to the place in
which they lived should be carried on in the best,
most comfortable way, with justice for everybody.
But, unfortunately, there have always been
some people who want the best only for themselves,
and are not willing to be just to other
people.  In our own natures, many of us find a
conflict between desiring to be just to others, and
yet wishing a great deal for ourselves.
</p>

<p>
We can imagine what a long, long story, or
history there is in politics.
</p>

<p>
Politics have to do with the government of
communities, towns and cities and nations, and finally
all nations, since all nations are beginning to be
willing to agree among themselves.
</p>

<p>
For a very long time, perhaps always, people
have dreamed of perfect organization and perfect
government.
</p>

<p>
One of the most famous books ever written on
the subject of this hoped-for perfect government
is the work of the Greek philosopher Plato who
had been taught by Socrates.  The book is called
<i>The Republic of Plato</i> and it contains the
teaching of Socrates.
</p>

<p>
You may read in the last sentences of the ninth
book of <i>The Republic of Plato</i>, a description of
the perfect city.  Socrates had been explaining to
his pupils that the man of understanding will take
part in everything which will make him a better
man, and will shun what may make him less good.
So he will take part in politics.  <i>The Republic</i> is
written in the form of question and answer.
Finally Socrates says that the pattern of the
perfect city is perhaps laid up in heaven, but that,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P175"></a>175}</span>
as far as he can, the man of understanding will
follow its practices.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
It would scarcely be possible to make a complete
list of famous men who have been statesmen
or politicians, because the list would be so long.
But in this chapter we can choose a few names
of men who have been political leaders in Great
Britain, Canada, and the British Empire.
</p>

<p>
A political leader generally is a speaker or
orator.  Nothing, possibly, is more thrilling than
to listen to a great speech.  Read carefully the
few political sentences which follow here, and see
if you do not experience a thrill, a sense that here
is something that belongs to you.
</p>

<p>
The first sentences quoted were spoken by
William Pitt, Earl of Chatham, in the House of
Lords, 1770.  Pitt, before he became a member of
the British House of Commons, had been a
soldier.
</p>

<p>
"I am now suspected of coming forward, in the
decline of life, in the anxious pursuit of wealth
and power, which it is impossible for me to
enjoy.  Be it so; there is one ambition at least
which I ever will acknowledge, which I will not
renounce but with my life&mdash;it is the ambition of
delivering to my posterity those rights of freedom
which I have received from my ancestors.  I
am not now pleading the cause of an individual,
but of every freeholder in England."
</p>

<p>
Edmund Burke, an Irishman, was a great
orator.  He laid down and taught principles of
government which have a great deal to do with
the way in which government in the British
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P176"></a>176}</span>
Empire is organized to-day.  Here is one sentence
which he spoke in the British House of Commons
in 1780.
</p>

<p>
"The service of the public is a thing which
cannot be put to auction, and struck down to those
who will agree to execute it the cheapest."
</p>

<p>
Richard Cobden was an economist.  He was the
son of a farmer, and was himself a manufacturer.
His speeches are for the most part plain and
simple, and deal generally with the change in
Great Britain from protection to free trade.  The
following sentences were spoken in the British
House of Commons in 1845.  The second half of
the last sentence contains teaching which is
memorable.
</p>

<p>
"This is a new era.  It is the age of improvement,
it is the age of social advancement, not
the age for war or for feudal sports.  You live in
a mercantile age, when the whole wealth of the
world is poured into your lap.  You cannot have
the advantages of commercial rents and feudal
privileges; but you may be what you always have
been, if you will identify yourselves with the
spirit of the age."
</p>

<p>
D'Arcy McGee, a Canadian statesman, was
born and educated in Ireland.  He spoke and
laboured for the confederation of the Provinces
which was consummated in the Dominion of
Canada in 1867.  The sentences that follow belong
to a speech given before the Legislative
Assembly of Upper and Lower Canada in 1865:
</p>

<p>
"The principle of Federation is a generous
one.  It is a principle that gives men local duties
to discharge, and invests them at the same time
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P177"></a>177}</span>
with general supervision, that excites a healthy
sense of responsibility and comprehension."
</p>

<p>
When we read over these sentences, we may
obtain a sense of the meaning of government, and
of the greatness of politics.  Notice that the men
who speak are in earnest.  Their sentences are
practical and simple.  Great politics and great
statesmen, almost invariably, are characterized by
earnestness and sincerity; and great political
sayings, as a rule, are practical.  Countless
numbers of men have devoted themselves to political
government, not for their own gain, but for the
service of their country, and eventually of the
world.  There are those who go into politics for
their own gain solely, but we do not call them
patriots.  The study of such sentences as are
quoted in this chapter will help us to understand
something of the government and history of
Canada, Great Britain and the Empire.  Boys and
girls and young people should be interested in
government, for every country needs the help of
the younger generations in its political affairs.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
The greatest political sentence ever spoken
is,&mdash;"Love your enemies."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Some day you should plan to visit a great library
and ask to be shown facsimiles of a few of
the famous Acts by which liberties have been won
and our government has been assured.  One of the
greatest Acts in the history of the English-speaking
world is the Great Charter obtained in King
John's time, 1215, and signed by him and many
of the barons.  Be sure to see a facsimile of this, if
you can, and read especially clause 40.

<p>
"To no one will we sell, to no one will we
refuse, or delay right or justice."
</p>

<p>
The Confederation Act of the Dominion of
Canada, or the British North America Act, as it is
properly called, is dated 1867.  Its plainness,
simplicity and scrupulous fairness make it worthy of
admiration.
</p>

<p>
In Charlottetown, the capital of the Province
of Prince Edward Island, set in the assembly hall
of the Parliament Buildings, is a tablet to mark
the place where the Fathers of Confederation met
and deliberated.  These are the words which you
may read on the tablet, as well as the names of
the men who resolved that there should be a
Dominion of Canada:
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXVI
<br><br>
HISTORIES
</h3>

<p>
It will take us a little while even to imagine
how many important books there are in which
famous historians have written of history
and politics.
</p>

<p>
Why should so many books need to be written
about history?
</p>

<p>
Because in this way we are able to trace the
long, fascinating story of how mankind&mdash;men and
women, your fathers and mothers, their fathers
and mothers, and so on back for a thousand
generations&mdash;has been gradually gaining in
knowledge and growing, we trust, if even only a very
little, more kind and more just.
</p>

<p>
But let us forget all this for a few minutes.  It
is a good time to look about our treasure house,
and see, or reckon up, as it were, what we have
found in it.
</p>

<p>
If we had to write a fairy tale about books, we
could easily imagine that all the famous books in
the world were kept in a great, very beautiful
palace, and that books of different kinds were
arranged in halls, galleries and great rooms which
had been assigned to them.
</p>

<p>
There might very well be a special, beautiful,
walled garden, belonging to the palace, for fairy
tales, myths, fables and such books.
</p>

<p>
What a wonderful, great room, or rather series
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P180"></a>180}</span>
of great rooms, must be kept for stories and
novels!
</p>

<p>
And exquisite galleries, with vaulted roofs, and
open courts, where fountains play,&mdash;the water
falling with a pleasant sound into marble basins,&mdash;and
with beautiful statues in the courts, we will
choose for songs, ballads, and great poetry.
</p>

<p>
Famous books of history, political speeches,
lives of great men, books of travel and discovery,
may be arranged in a stately hall, with alcoves,
stained glass windows, and marble busts of some
of the great men that we read about.
</p>

<p>
Shall we imagine that we will pay a visit to a
few of the alcoves in the great hall of history,
and take down from the shelves, here one book,
and here another, reading their names, and
learning the names of those who wrote the books?
</p>

<p>
We do not learn very much about a book simply
by taking it down from a shelf, and turning over
a few of the pages; but we do learn something.
Many of you will read a certain number of these
books some day.  All of us may know something
about them.  At least we all can remember that
famous histories, as well as other books, have
helped to make this delightful, thrilling, difficult,
very important world in which we live.
</p>

<p>
Now what books shall we take down from the
shelves?
</p>

<p>
Suppose we begin with a book written by
someone you know,&mdash;Sir Walter Raleigh.
</p>

<p>
When Sir Walter Raleigh came back from one
of his sea expeditions, on which, after the fashion
of the times in which he lived, he had been more
or less of a buccaneer, he was put into prison in
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P181"></a>181}</span>
the Tower of London on account of a political
quarrel in which he was involved.  Time spent in
prison seems very long, especially for a man like
Raleigh.  So he began to write a <i>History of the
World</i>.  He never finished it, but he got as far on
as B.C. 130.  You can handle to-day one of the
great books in which Raleigh's <i>History of the
World</i> is printed; but very few people ever read it.
</p>

<p>
But at the end of what Raleigh wrote of
the <i>History of the World</i>, he penned a noble
sentence which people have never forgotten.  Here
it is:
</p>

<p>
"O eloquent, just, and mightie Death! whom
none could advise, thou hast perswaded; what
none hath dared, thou hast done; and whom all
the world hath flattered, thou only hast cast out of
the world and despised.  Thou hast drawne
together all the farre stretched greatnesse, all the
pride, crueltie, and ambition of man, and covered
it all over with these two narrow words, <i>Hic
jacet</i>!"
</p>

<p>
We know that there is, or perhaps we should
say that there used to be, a sharp division between
ancient and modern history.  One of the first
writers to connect modern with ancient history
was an Englishman whose name was Edward
Gibbon.  He wrote a book called <i>The History of
the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire</i>.  Do
any of you happen to remember that in Dickens'
novel, <i>Our Mutual Friend</i>, Mr. Boffin paid Silas
Wegg to read aloud to him so that he might
become a little better educated?  Mr. Boffin had
chosen Gibbon's <i>Decline and Fall of the Roman
Empire</i> for Silas Wegg to read to him.  It is a
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P182"></a>182}</span>
remarkable book, and it made a great impression
on the scholarship of the world.  Gibbon himself
was a clever, but somewhat odd man.  He chose
to live and write a good part of his time, not in his
own country, but in Switzerland.  Gibbon is an
international author.  Not only the people of his
own country, but those of other countries as well,
read his great work.  He lived in the eighteenth
century, and he belonged to Dr. Johnson's club.
We are going to hear something of Dr. Samuel
Johnson in another chapter.  Certainly, we should
take down Gibbon's history from the shelves, and
look at it.  Some of you probably will read it later
with interest and pleasure.
</p>

<p>
Lord Macaulay, who wrote <i>The Lays of Ancient
Rome</i>, was an able historian.  He lived from 1800
to 1859.  Gibbon had died six years before Macaulay
was born.  Macaulay was a graduate of Cambridge,
a lawyer and a writer.  He was a member
of Parliament, and lived for several years in
India, where he gave splendid governmental
service.  His <i>History of England</i> is a famous book.
When it was first published it was read with as
much eagerness as if it had been a thrilling novel.
It still charms a multitude of readers.  Take down
the first volume of his <i>History of England</i> from
the shelf, and read in the first chapter two
paragraphs that speak of Cromwell and of the gallant
bearing of Charles the First at his execution.
Perhaps you may remember reading a story by
Dumas which tells of the same event.  Anyone who
cares for history will find delight in Macaulay's
famous book.
</p>

<p>
Here is Napier's <i>History of the War in the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P183"></a>183}</span>
Peninsula</i>, in which you may read of the campaigns
of Wellington.  If you will look at his preface
you will find noble praise of Wellington's
army.  Here are John Richard Green's <i>Short
History of the English People</i>, and Miss Agnes
Strickland's <i>Queens of England</i>.  Here are
histories by Carlyle, and by Lecky, who was an
Irishman, and many others, and here is John Lothrop
Motley's <i>Rise of the Dutch Republic</i>.  Motley was
an American, who, like many other historians,
chose a favourite hero of whom to write.  His
hero was William the Silent.  The last sentence of
Motley's history reads: "As long as he lived he
was the guiding-star of a whole brave nation, and
when he died the little children cried in the
streets."
</p>

<p>
One of the first writers who made plain to the
world the entrancing history of New France,
which, as you know, is an earlier name for
Canada, was the historian Francis Parkman.
Parkman was born in Boston near the end of the
eighteenth century.  He devoted himself to historical
research, and wrote a long series of books, many
of the names of which are familiar to you.
</p>

<p>
Some of the titles of these volumes written by
Parkman are <i>Pioneers of France in the New
World</i>, <i>The Jesuits in North America</i>, <i>The
Discovery of the Great West</i>, <i>The Old Régime in
Canada</i>, <i>Frontenac and New France Under Louis
XIV</i>, and <i>The Conspiracy of Pontiac</i>.
</p>

<p>
Parkman begins <i>The Conspiracy of Pontiac</i>,
which he completed in 1851, with the paragraph
quoted below.  It is interesting to note the great
changes which have come about on this continent
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P184"></a>184}</span>
since Parkman wrote this history, nearly eighty
years ago.
</p>

<p>
"The Indian is a true child of the forest and the
desert.  The wastes and solitudes of nature are
his congenial home.  His haughty mind is imbued
with the spirit of the wilderness, and the light of
civilization falls on him with a blighting power.
His unruly pride and untamed freedom are in
harmony with the lonely mountains, cataracts and
rivers among which he dwells; and primitive
America, with her savage scenery and savage
men, opens to the imagination a boundless world,
unmatched in wild sublimity."
</p>

<p>
Biography sometimes is closely related to
history.  When the life of a famous public man is
written in such a way as to tell the story of how
his actions have changed the history of his
country, biography and history seem practically
identical.  The story of Queen Elizabeth is, one may
say, the story, or history, of England during her
reign.  The same statement is partly true of the
biography of Queen Victoria.  It is true also of
the life of any great public man in any country.
Books of biography are widely read in this
twentieth century.  Most of the people you know read
biographies.
</p>

<p>
If we find the alcove in which are kept the newest
books in the hall of history, we will discover
on the shelves such volumes as Sir Sidney Lee's
<i>Life of King Edward VII</i>, Mr. Lytton Strachey's
<i>Queen Victoria</i>, his <i>Elisabeth and Essex</i>, and
Mr. Philip Guedalla's <i>Life of Palmerston</i>.  These are
all clearly written, easy to read, condensed rather
than long drawn out, based on sound historical
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P185"></a>185}</span>
research and so fascinating that thousands of
people begin to read them as soon as they are
published.
</p>

<p>
Here is a little book of history called <i>Gallipoli</i>,
which was published in 1916.  It was written by a
poet, John Masefield, and it tells the story of the
Australians when they fought on the Gallipoli
Peninsula in the Great War.  There are many
notable histories of different campaigns in the
War, but none surely will last longer than this
small, noble book.
</p>

<p>
Now we know the names of a few histories by
historians of English-speaking countries.  There
are many other histories written by Italians,
Frenchmen, Germans, and others.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Before we leave books of history, shall we look
at a history of English literature, so that we may
mark down for ourselves the names of the periods,
or times, when some of the great writers lived?
</p>

<p>
There was an Anglo-Saxon period before William
the Conqueror came to England.  Poets and
writers lived then, but only learned scholars read
now the works they composed.  You are likely to
read at some time of Beowulf, who is supposed to
have written about 520, and of Cædmon, who is
said to have been a servant at the monastery of
Whitby under the Abbess Hilda.
</p>

<p>
The first great English poet, who was the master
of a period of English poetry, was Chaucer.
His work brings us to the fourteenth century.
He had a number of less famous contemporaries.
</p>

<p>
Many of the old ballads were made probably in
the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P186"></a>186}</span>
Sir Thomas Malory wrote his book <i>Morte
d'Arthur</i> in the fifteenth century.
</p>

<p>
The first book was printed in England by Caxton
in 1477.
</p>

<p>
The Elizabethan Age, as you know, is one of the
most famous periods in English literature.  It is
generally divided into an earlier and a later
period.  Spenser belonged to the earlier time; and
Shakespeare marked the later period, along with
other notable writers.  The Elizabethan age is
reckoned to have lasted longer than Elizabeth's
reign, because writers still wrote in the same
fashion and spirit.  The authorized translation
of the Bible into English was written at this time.
</p>

<p>
In the time of the Commonwealth and later,
when England was largely puritan, the great poet
Milton lived, and John Bunyan, who wrote <i>The
Pilgrim's Progress</i>.
</p>

<p>
Dryden, a poet, belongs to the second part of
the seventeenth century.  Pope, another poet, lived
most of his life in the eighteenth century.  A
number of novelists, Defoe, who wrote <i>Robinson
Crusoe</i>, of an earlier date than the others, and
Richardson, Fielding, Sterne, Smollett, all great
novelists, come in the late seventeenth and earlier
eighteenth centuries.
</p>

<p>
A group of distinguished men, some of whom
we will learn a little about in the next chapter,
lived in the eighteenth century.  Their names
are Johnson; Goldsmith; Burke, the statesman;
Gibbon, the historian; Garrick, an actor; and
Reynolds, the painter.  Swift, Addison, Steele,
and other essayists, wrote earlier in the same
century.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P187"></a>187}</span>
</p>

<p>
You do not need to remember specially the
various ages in which writers lived.  But we
understand now that people often speak of periods
in English literature; it is interesting to fit into
their proper places great writers whose names we
know.
</p>

<p>
Scott and Jane Austen belong to the end of the
eighteenth and the beginning of the nineteenth
century.
</p>

<p>
Dickens, Thackeray, and many others, lived and
wrote in the nineteenth century, and are great
Victorians.  Hardy is partly Victorian and partly
Georgian.  Kipling and Barrie belong to the late
nineteenth and early twentieth century.  We live
now in the first half of the twentieth century.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXVII
<br><br>
BOSWELL'S LIFE OF JOHNSON
</h3>

<p>
A man called James Boswell, who lived in the
eighteenth century, chose as his hero a
celebrated personage whose name was
Samuel Johnson.  Boswell was willing, indeed
eager and determined, to go about with Johnson
from place to place, to listen to what he said, and
then to make notes of Johnson's conversation.
Boswell was a devoted friend, and Johnson was
worthy of his friendship, for he was a truly great
man.  Boswell spared no pains to learn everything
that he could of Johnson's youth, of his
family and friends, of his work and character.  In
this way, James Boswell prepared himself to
write the life of Dr. Johnson.
</p>

<p>
Boswell's <i>Life of Johnson</i> is certainly one of
the greatest biographies ever written.  Many
people think that it is the greatest of all
biographies, because it tells us with truth, fidelity
and fullness what manner of man Dr. Johnson
was.
</p>

<p>
There are many odd things about Boswell's
<i>Life of Johnson</i>.  One of the oddest is that Johnson
did not like Scotland, or the people of Scotland,
but Boswell was a Scot.  Johnson, who was
outspoken in an extraordinary degree, and somewhat
rough, rather what we call a bear of a man, was
often rude to Boswell, who, perhaps, was not a
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P189"></a>189}</span>
little tiresome.  But Boswell never minded what
happened, or what was said, as long as he could
be in Johnson's company.
</p>

<p>
Samuel Johnson's parents were very poor.  He
was not even a strong boy, and was often ill.  One
of the reasons why we admire Johnson is that he
contended bravely with poverty and ill-health all
his life.  He never put money first, or perhaps he
might have been rich, in which case, possibly, we
might never have heard of him.  He does not seem
to have thought it any particular hardship to
suffer from ill-health.  He does not talk, or write,
of being ill.  What he did put first in his life was
scholarship, work, friendship, companionship, and
living in accordance with high principles.
</p>

<p>
How do we know all this, and how can we be
certain that it is true?  We know because we find
Johnson's character in Boswell's <i>Life</i>.  No one
can read this <i>Life of Johnson</i> by Boswell without
being certain that Boswell took great pains to
write what was true, and that he succeeded.
</p>

<p>
Johnson's father was a bookseller in a small
way in the English city of Lichfield, where there is
a beautiful cathedral, which some day you may
see.  Both Johnson's father and mother did everything
they could for their son.  It soon was evident
at home and at school that the boy had an unusually
fine intelligence.  He went to Oxford as a
sizar.  This means that he had not enough money
to live on, so he worked in the college to pay his
way.  There were few opportunities then for
students to earn money.  Samuel Johnson had a fine,
sturdy self-respect.  He was poor, but he was not
ashamed of being poor.  When someone, who knew
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P190"></a>190}</span>
that his clothes were shabby, put a pair of boots
outside his door, Johnson threw the boots out of
the window.  He was not the kind of man to take
help.  There is something comical about this story.
We cannot help laughing, yet we like, and respect,
the shabby student who was independent.  Johnson
was not good-looking, and he had odd tricks of
manner, but his mind and character impressed
everyone.
</p>

<p>
One day, when he was a famous man, he performed
what he considered an act of penance in
memory of his father.  His father, whose business
was going very badly, had wanted him to stand
beside a bookstall in Uttoxeter, near Lichfield, and
sell any books that he could.  Johnson was not
willing to do this.  Afterwards, he must have
regretted his refusal keenly.  Many years later,
when he visited Lichfield with friends, they missed
him one day from breakfast till night.  Presently
he drove up in a post chaise; and when they
inquired urgently what he had been doing, he told
them the story of how he had been unwilling to
help his father.  To show his sorrow, he had gone
to Uttoxeter and had stood, bareheaded, beside
the bookstall from which his father used to sell
books, for an hour at the busiest time of day.
Perhaps some people might think it was an odd thing
for him to do.  But only a great and humble spirit
can inspire anyone to carry out such an action.
</p>

<p>
After he left Oxford, he was a tutor.  But since
his appearance and manner were both odd, he had
difficulty in finding and keeping situations.  All
the while he wanted to be a writer, and we may be
sure that he practised writing.  He married, when
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P191"></a>191}</span>
he was a comparatively young man, a widow much
older than he was.  He was deeply attached to his
wife.  After her death, years later, he never ceased
to mourn for her, and he treasured every memory
of their life together.
</p>

<p>
Long before this happened, however, Johnson
had gone to London, and had become what is
called a hack writer.  He earned very little by his
writing.  These were early days in journalism,
when newspaper writers suffered hardship,
probably because the occupation was not yet fully
established, and work was ill-paid.  Much has been
written of this period among men of letters in
London, and of the straits to which they were
driven to keep alive.  It was out of such conditions
as these that Johnson made himself famous, until
every word he wrote, or spoke, carried weight,
and he himself had greater authority among
writers, and with his contemporaries, than,
possibly, any other man of letters has ever had.
</p>

<p>
You will find in an interesting novel, called
<i>Midwinter</i>, written by John Buchan, a delightful
account of Johnson when he was a tutor and later,
before he had become famous.
</p>

<p>
Johnson wrote a great deal, but his Dictionary
is often called his most famous work.  It took him
years to complete the Dictionary, and the task
required all his scholarship, together with much
toil, carried on in poverty and privation.  When
the Dictionary was finished, Johnson was a famous
man.  It is likely that he enjoyed making his
Dictionary.  The work suited his temperament.  One
can imagine how he would choose the words, as if
he were a judge or umpire, as indeed he was,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P192"></a>192}</span>
deciding that certain words were to be included,
and refusing others.  Some of his definitions are
amusing.  Dictionaries now are much more
elaborate.  The science of words has grown greatly
since Johnson's day.  But he was a pioneer in the
making of a dictionary, and we greatly honour
pioneers.
</p>

<p>
Then there was Dr. Johnson's club, which met
at an eating house on a famous street in London
named the Strand.  Great numbers of people visit
the Cheshire Cheese every year because it is
generally believed that Dr. Johnson and his friends
used to dine there, and there carried on discussions,
some of which no doubt Boswell duly reported
in his biography.
</p>

<p>
It is a wonderful achievement to have kept for
the world so perfectly the looks, words, and
characters of Dr. Johnson and his associates, many of
whom were famous men.  But Dr. Johnson was the
leader.  He it was who kept the club together;
for, although he was arbitrary, odd, and
sometimes brusque and rude, he was astonishingly
companionable, affectionate, sincere and very
able.  His conversation was weighty, full of pith
and meaning.  It was a highly esteemed privilege
to belong to Dr. Johnson's club.
</p>

<p>
The names of some of his associates are Garrick,
the great actor, who came to London from
Lichfield with Johnson; Goldsmith, who was a
poet, and who wrote plays, as well as one wise and
beautiful novel called <i>The Vicar of Wakefield</i>;
Reynolds, the great painter, and others not as well
known, and Boswell.
</p>

<p>
If you will find a copy of Boswell's <i>Life of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P193"></a>193}</span>
Johnson</i>&mdash;remember, it is a large book, in four
volumes&mdash;and turn to the index at the end, you
will discover under the heading Johnson, His
Character and Manners, numbers indicating the
pages where are printed some stories that you will
enjoy reading.  On pages 162 and 163 of the fourth
volume, we read of his love for children, and his
affection for Hodge, his cat, for whom he used to
buy oysters.  Almost every page contains good
reading, as, for instance, beginning at page 300,
in the same volume, we may read of his conversation
with a young man whom he thought presumptuous,
followed immediately by an account of the
plan of some of his friends to send him to Italy
since he was ill, and of how greatly touched
Johnson was by their kindness.  Boswell's <i>Life of
Johnson</i> is one of the books which the world has
enjoyed reading ever since it was written.
</p>

<p>
And now we come to something about this
biography that may seem curious.  If Boswell had
tried to describe Dr. Johnson as being handsome,
and polite, instead of unprepossessing and
sometimes rude, he likely would have made him seem
not nearly as great a man as Johnson really is.
The biography would not have been a true picture
of Dr. Johnson.  A true picture makes a far deeper
impression than a picture which is not true; and
this is one of the very most important things we
can learn about a book.

CHAPTER XXVIII
<br><br>
READING FOR WHAT YOU WANT TO BE
</h3>

<p>
Biography is not only interesting reading,
it helps us to understand other people.  In
this chapter we may discover that there are
few better ways of finding out what kind of work
we want to undertake than by reading biography.
</p>

<p>
First of all, let us think of a very few famous
biographies, such books as Plutarch's <i>Lives</i>,
Boswell's <i>Johnson</i>, Lockhart's <i>Scott</i>, Forster's
<i>Dickens</i>, Morley's <i>Life of Gladstone</i>, Churchill's <i>Lord
Randolph Churchill</i>, Page's <i>Life and Letters</i>, Sir
Sidney Lee's <i>Shakespeare</i>.
</p>

<p>
Numberless people have read and used
Plutarch's <i>Lives of Illustrious Men</i>.  We know that
Shakespeare did.  If you will turn to the last life
in Plutarch's book, the life of Brutus, you will
find that Shakespeare must have used this
biography of Brutus when he wrote the play <i>Julius
Cæsar</i>.
</p>

<p>
Now we may think of biography as a magic key
that will help you to unlock the door behind which
you may find what work you are going to do.  Let
us ask ourselves what occupations these famous
men followed whose lives appear in the list given
above.
</p>

<p>
Johnson was a journalist, and an author, and
he made a dictionary.  Scott was a lawyer, an
officer of the Crown, and a novelist; one might
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P195"></a>195}</span>
almost add that he was something of a farmer.
You remember how he loved the land he owned at
Abbotsford, and used to ride over it and talk
with his men about their work.  Dickens was a
reporter, a novelist, and, towards the end of his
life, he gave public readings from his works.
Gladstone was a statesman; he had great skill in
finance; and on account of his associations at
home, he had somewhat of the training of a
business man.  He also was interested in the land.
You may read in his biography how he used to
employ himself cutting down trees, that needed
to be felled, on his estate.  Lord Randolph
Churchill was a statesman.  Page was an editor,
and a diplomatist.  Shakespeare was an actor, the
manager of a theatre, and a dramatist.  Already
you know how to find in biography some
knowledge of a good many different occupations.
</p>

<p>
A great many of you will be farmers.  The
well-being and health of the world depend directly on
farming; and the life of a farmer and of a
farmer's family may be happy, independent and
wonderfully useful and interesting.  To learn
about the life of a farmer, one must read other
books as well as biography.  Three of the novels
that we have enjoyed reading contain vivid, true
pictures of the life of people who live on a farm.
The first of these novels is Scott's <i>Guy Mannering</i>.
You remember the farm called Charlies-hope,
and Dandie Dinmont and his wife and children.
Scott dearly loved and thoroughly understood
country life, and there is no more charming
picture in a book of the natural, happy life of the
farmer and his wife and children than in this
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P196"></a>196}</span>
novel by Scott.  The second novel is George
Eliot's <i>Adam Bede</i>.  Mr. and Mrs. Poyser had
much skill in their occupation.  It is interesting to
discover how well Mrs. Poyser understands farming,
especially dairy farming.  <i>Lorna Doone</i> is
another novel about farm people.  A Scottish poet,
Robert Burns, was the son of a tenant farmer, and
was himself a ploughman and a farmer.  He has
written much that is exquisite about country life.
Ask someone to read aloud to you "The Cotter's
Saturday Night", a wonderful picture of family
affection and good living.  You may find some of
the words hard to understand.  But whoever it is
that reads the poem aloud to you will likely find
the difficult words explained in a glossary.  These
are all English and Scottish writers.  Hamlin
Garland has written a good deal about the life of
an American farmer, moving to new settlements,
in his book called <i>A Son of the Middle Border</i>.  In
Will Carleton's verse and James Whitcombe
Riley's verse we find songs and stories of farm
life.  Peter McArthur's books, <i>In Pastures Green</i>,
<i>The Red Cow and Her Friends</i>, and <i>Around
Home</i>, contain true, intimate, delightful pictures
of farming in the older provinces of Canada.
</p>

<p>
And so we see how interesting reading about
occupations may be.  In the list that follows most
of the books are biographies, lives of sailors,
soldiers, architects, teachers, clergymen, business
men, bankers, lawyers, actors, doctors, painters,
craftsmen, journalists, nurses, musicians,
explorers, scientists, workmen.  There are other books,
as well, about animals, and plants, nature and
country walks, flying, mountain climbing, inventions,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P197"></a>197}</span>
hobbies, and science, about some of the
many wonderful pursuits in which you are interested
already, or in which you will be interested
soon.
</p>

<p>
If you look in the list for the name of some
particular book and do not find it, whether it is
the name of a biography belonging to some
occupation, or of a book telling about some recreation
of which you want to learn, you may go to a
library and ask for help in finding the book.  Or
if you cannot go to the library, write to the
librarian and ask him to tell you.
</p>

<p>
Some day you may make a list of your own
favourite books.  No one person needs to read all
the books named here, but boys and girls may
choose from the list a few of the books they want
to read.  In the case of birds, flowers, and the
study of nature, each neighbourhood or district
of country needs to be classified according to its
latitude and longitude.  Birds, flowers and plants
vary according to climate; look for their descriptions
in books belonging to your own district of
country.

CHAPTER XXIX
<br><br>
TRAVEL AND DISCOVERY
</h3>

<p>
Marco Polo, a famous traveller, was
born in the City of Venice in 1254, eleven
years before the birth of Dante.  Dante
belonged to Florence: so Marco Polo and Dante
both were Italians.  Marco Polo's father and
uncle were trading merchants.  They travelled by
ship and overland to sell their goods, and they
were probably among the first Europeans to visit
the kingdom of China, even yet a mysterious,
strange part of the world to us.  When Marco was
seventeen years old, his father and uncle took him
with them on one of their expeditions.  He was
away from Italy twenty-six years.  In that time,
he saw many marvels, became a favourite of the
great emperor Kublai Khan, and had more
astonishing adventures, almost, than we can imagine.
He came back safely to Italy, but was thrown into
prison in Genoa; you remember that these cities
of what is now Italy were often at war with one
another.  When Marco Polo was in prison, he told
some of his adventures to a fellow-prisoner, and
this man induced Marco Polo to write a book.
Polo dictated what he wished to say, and Rustician
wrote it down.
</p>

<p>
Marco Polo's book, <i>The Travels of Marco Polo</i>,
has had a considerable effect on the history of the
world.  Columbus used to read it, and often quoted
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P203"></a>203}</span>
what Marco Polo said.  It is likely, almost
certain, that Polo's example and success helped to
inspire Columbus to make his great voyage to the
Western hemisphere.
</p>

<p>
We can judge how interesting and delightful
Marco Polo's book is from a brief extract which
contains the description of a hill that the Emperor
Kublai Khan had had made and planted with
trees:
</p>

<p>
"Moreover, on the north side of the Palace,
about a bow-shot off, there is a hill which has been
made by art from the earth dug out of the lake; it
is a good hundred paces in height and a mile in
compass.  This hill is entirely covered with trees
that never lose their leaves, but remain ever
green.  And I assure you that wherever a beautiful
tree may exist, and the Emperor gets news of it,
he sends for it and has it transported bodily with
all its roots and the earth attached to them, and
planted on that hill of his.  No matter how big
the tree may be, he gets it carried by his
elephants; and in this way he has got together the
most beautiful collection of trees in all the world.
And he has also caused the whole hill to be covered
with the ore of azure, which is very green.  And
thus not only are the trees all green, but the hill
itself is all green likewise; and there is nothing
to be seen on it that is not green."
</p>

<p>
Cook's <i>Voyages</i> is another famous book of
exploration.  James Cook was born in 1728 and
was the son of a farm labourer.  As a boy, he was
apprenticed first to a shopkeeper, then to a
shipowner.  He entered the King's service in 1755.
The accounts of his voyages, or explorations, to
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P204"></a>204}</span>
the North and West, South and East, in the days
when comparatively little was known of the seas
in which he sailed, are as interesting and exciting
as a story.  His first expedition South was to
observe the transit of Venus, when he was in
command of the <i>Endeavour</i>.  On this expedition he
visited New Zealand and Australia.  His next
voyage, when he also visited the Pacific, was with
the <i>Resolution</i> and the <i>Adventure</i>.  On his second
expedition he discovered the Sandwich Islands.
He sailed for nearly four thousand miles along
the western coast of North America, searching
for a north-west passage, on his third expedition.
His ships were the <i>Resolution</i> and the <i>Discovery</i>.
The <i>Discovery</i> is perhaps the best known
ship in which Cook sailed.  The purpose of all his
expeditions was largely scientific.  On his last
voyage, Cook lost his life.  It has been said that
his best memorial is the map of the Pacific.
</p>

<p>
Captain Cook wrote in a very simple, natural
style.  Here is a description of some of the people
he saw, on the way to the place which he named
Poverty Bay.  We can almost imagine that we
might have been on the ship with Captain Cook,
or venturing ashore, not at all certain what the
unknown inhabitants of unknown islands might
not do to us.  The paragraph is taken from the
account of his first expedition:
</p>

<p>
"In the evening, the weather having become
fair and moderate, the boats were again ordered
out, and I landed, accompanied by Mr. Banks and
Dr. Solander.  We were received with great
expressions of friendship by the natives, who
behaved with a scrupulous attention not to give
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P205"></a>205}</span>
offence.  In particular, they took care not to
appear in great bodies: one family, or the inhabitants
of two or three houses only, were generally
placed together, to the number of fifteen or
twenty, consisting of men, women, and children.
These little companies sat upon the ground, not
advancing towards us, but inviting us to them, by
a kind of beckon, moving one hand towards the
breast.  We made them several little presents;
and in our walk round the bay found two small
streams of fresh water.  This convenience, and
the friendly behaviour of the people, determined
me to stay at least a day, that I might fill some of
my empty casks, and give Mr. Banks an opportunity
of examining the natural produce of the
country."
</p>

<p>
Captain Cook and his people were often in
danger from the anger of the strange tribes they met,
but we can have only admiration for the gentle
behaviour of the people whose home Cook visited
on this occasion, as described in his account of
the expedition.  There are many dramatic scenes
in Cook's <i>Voyages</i>.  Captain Cook was not only
brave, he had extraordinary perseverance.
</p>

<p>
Many of us find stories of travels, discoveries
and explorations among the most interesting
books in the world.  We travel, too, with the great
explorers, by means of these books, and have a
share in their dangers, escapes, and discoveries.
Explorers are always courageous, and often men
of noble character.  A few women have been noted
explorers, but only a few, partly because
travelling alone and in danger, is more difficult for a
woman than for a man.  Miss Mary Kingsley is
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P206"></a>206}</span>
one of these notable exceptions.  Here are the
names of a few books of travel and discovery, old
and new: <i>How I Found Livingstone in Central
Africa</i>, by Henry M. Stanley; Sir Richard
Burton's <i>Pilgrimage to Mecca</i>; <i>Travels in West
Africa</i>, by Mary H. Kingsley; the <i>Journals</i> of
Captain R. F. Scott, the explorer who reached the
South Pole to find that the Danes, led by
Amundsen, had been a few days before him, the account
is often called <i>Scott's Last Expedition</i>, a very
noble book; and a fascinating volume by
T. E. Lawrence, <i>Revolt in the Desert</i>.  The discoverer
of the Mississippi was La Salle.  We may read of
him in Parkman.  Two books of early travels in
Canada are Sir Alexander Mackenzie's <i>Voyages
from Montreal Through the Continent of North
America</i>, and Alexander Henry's <i>Travels and
Adventures in Canada and the Indian Territories</i>.

CHAPTER XXX
<br><br>
CHARLES LAMB AND HAZLITT: ESSAYISTS AND CRITICS
</h3>

<p>
Charles Lamb is a friend of yours whom
you may not know yet; but, when you meet
him, you will soon find yourself thinking of
Charles Lamb as a friend.  He is one of the rare
persons who attract and deserve everybody's
love.  Charles Lamb lived all his life in London,
where he was born; he went to a famous school,
often called the Bluecoat School, because the boys
were dressed after that fashion.  His first home
was in the Temple.  "I was born and passed the
first seven years of my life in the Temple.  Its
church, its halls, its gardens, its fountain, its
river, I had almost said&mdash;for in those young years
what was this king of rivers to me but a stream
that watered our pleasant places?&mdash;these are my
oldest recollections."
</p>

<p>
When he grew up he entered the service of the
East India Company and worked there as a clerk
all his working life.  The offices belonging to the
East India Company were known as the South
Sea House.  People think of this building with
interest and affection, because Charles Lamb
worked in it.  Besides being a clerk, he wrote in
his leisure time a series of papers, or essays,
which deal with many different subjects in a
whimsical, gentle, beautiful style.  The manner
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P210"></a>210}</span>
of writing which Lamb used expressed his nature
and abilities perfectly.  His work is full of sweet
laughter, great penetration, unselfishness, and
nobility.  No wonder we love Charles Lamb.  The
essays are known as <i>The Essays of Elia</i>.  Lamb
is supposed to have taken Elia as a pen name
from the name of a fellow-clerk in the South Sea
House.
</p>

<p>
Only one sister and one brother out of a rather
large family grew up to maturity with Charles
Lamb.  This sister, whose name was Mary, suffered
often from a serious illness, and her brother
Charles devoted himself to her care.  Mary Lamb
also was gifted and lovable.  Neither of them
married.  Charles and Mary Lamb wrote together
a book for young people, called <i>Tales from
Shakespeare</i>.
</p>

<p>
The history of the attachment between this
brother and sister is one of the most beautiful
stories we know of family affection.  Charles was
a gay, happy person, chivalrous and tender-hearted.
He loved jokes, but there were sad happenings
in his life which he met with great courage.
He stammered a little, but he was excellent
company, and gathered about him many friends,
themselves men of genius, such men as Coleridge
and Wordsworth, both great poets; Hazlitt, who
was a writer and critic; Crabb Robinson, Procter
and Talfourd, whose tastes were the same as his
own.  Charles Lamb lived from 1775 to 1834.  A
great deal has been written about him; two
especially delightful biographies of Lamb are those
written by Canon Ainger and by Mr. E. V. Lucas.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P211"></a>211}</span>
One or other of these you should read when you
have time.
</p>

<p>
But, first of all, there are his essays.  You will
soon discover that you have favourites among
these essays.  It is likely that you will find much
to your liking "Christ's Hospital Five-and-Thirty
Years Ago"&mdash;-this is written about his old
school&mdash;"Mrs. Battle's Opinions on Whist", "Mackery
End, in Hertfordshire", "The Old Benchers of
The Inner Temple", "Blakesmoor in H&mdash;shire",
but above all "A Dissertation Upon Roast Pig",
and "Dream Children".  You will enjoy almost
any of Lamb's essays read aloud by someone who
reads well.  But begin by reading "A Dissertation
Upon Roast Pig" yourself, if you cannot find
someone who will read it to you.  In this essay
Charles Lamb is, of course, writing humorously,
such amusing, whimsical humour.  It tells how a
small Chinese boy, Bo-bo, discovered by accident
that roasted meat tastes a great deal better than
meat which has not been cooked at all.
</p>

<p>
Essays, or papers, are short articles which deal
with one subject only.  They often, but not always,
by reason of their style, tell us a great deal about
the nature of the man or woman who has written
the essay.  No one can read Lamb's essays without
learning that the writer was lovable,
tender-hearted and upright.
</p>

<p>
Another famous essayist is Francis Bacon, a
very able man who lived as long ago as the reign
of Queen Elizabeth.  His essays are famous; they
are not as much concerned with the study of
human nature as the essays of Charles Lamb, but
are compact with learning, observation and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P212"></a>212}</span>
thought.  One of his best known and most likable
essays is "On Gardens".
</p>

<p>
Other famous essayists are: Addison, whose
Sir Roger de Coverley you may know already;
Steele; Swift; a great Frenchman, Montaigne,
who lived in the sixteenth century and whose
essays people generally read with pleasure when
they are middle-aged or older; and Robert Louis
Stevenson, who wrote <i>Treasure Island</i>.  Many of
his essays are especially beautiful; read "The
Lantern-Bearers" when you have an opportunity.
</p>

<p>
Essays, and books, often contain what is called
criticism.  Criticism is an explanation, an
appreciation, sometimes an analysis, of what has been
written in poetry, verse, fiction, history,
biography, and other published work; criticism deals
as well with art and music.
</p>

<p>
But we can understand better what criticism is
if we read one or two extracts which have been
written by critics.  Two of Lamb's friends,
Coleridge and Hazlitt, were famous critics.  Lamb
himself was one of the most discerning among
English critics.  He did not always care for work
which was really great, but when he did care for
a great piece of work, no one had more perfect
understanding than Charles Lamb.
</p>

<p>
What follows is part of a paragraph written by
Coleridge, a poet, of Shakespeare and Milton.  We
feel an enthusiasm in what Coleridge has
written which makes our own hearts glow.  This
feeling of elevation and happiness, given to us
through reading, is one of the tests of great work.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"What then shall we say? even this; that
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P213"></a>213}</span>
Shakespeare, no mere child of nature; no <i>automaton</i>
of genius; no passive vehicle of inspiration,
possessed by the spirit, not possessing it;
first studied patiently, meditated deeply,
understood minutely, till knowledge, become habitual
and intuitive, wedded itself to his habitual
feelings, and at length gave birth to that stupendous
power, by which he stands alone, with no equal
or second in his own class; to that power which
seated him on one of the two glory-smitten
summits of the poetic mountain, with Milton as his
compeer, not rival.  While the former darts
himself forth, and passes into all the forms of
human character and passion...; the other attracts
all forms and things to himself, into the unity of
his own ideal.  All things and modes of action
shape themselves anew in the being of Milton;
while Shakespeare becomes all things, yet for
ever remaining himself."  Some of this we can
understand.  Shakespeare and Milton both had
great genius.  But Shakespeare understood all
kinds of human beings and showed them as they
really were.  Milton changed what he wrote
about to be like himself.  What Shakespeare did,
of course, is the greater work of the two.
</p>

<p>
It is pleasant to read what the critic William
Hazlitt wrote in praise of the essays of his friend
Charles Lamb, not for friendship's sake merely,
but because he loved and valued the essays.
Notice, while Hazlitt seems to write easily and
simply, he succeeds in explaining to us at the same
time the charm and lasting quality of Charles
Lamb as a writer.  It is a fine, brief example of
one kind of criticism and of the work of a critic.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P214"></a>214}</span>
</p>

<p>
"With what a gusto Mr. Lamb describes the
inns and courts of law, the Temple and Gray's
Inn, as if he had been a student there for the last
two hundred years, and had been as well
acquainted with the person of Sir Francis Bacon as
he is with his portrait or writings! ... He (Lamb)
haunts Watling-street like a gentle spirit; ... and
Christ's-Hospital still breathes the balmy breath
of infancy in his description of it!  Whittington
and his Cat are a fine hallucination for
Mr. Lamb's historic Muse, and we believe he never
heartily forgave a certain writer who took the
subject of Guy Faux out of his hands.  The
streets of London are his fairy-land, teeming with
wonder, with life and interest to his retrospective
glance, as it did to the eager eye of childhood;
he has contrived to weave its tritest traditions
into a bright and endless romance!"  The quotation
from Coleridge is taken from his <i>Biographia
Literaria</i>, and Hazlitt's writing from his book
called <i>The Spirit of the Age and Lectures on
English poets</i>.
</p>

<p>
Other famous or eminent critics whose writings
you may read some day are: Matthew Arnold, a
poet as well as critic, whose father was the
Dr. Arnold of Engby School that you have read about
in <i>Tom Brown's School Days</i>; a Frenchman,
Sainte-Beuve, one of the clearest, and most
delightful of critical writers; another Frenchman,
H. A. Taine; and a Dane, Georg Brandes, a
learned writer, who was one of the first to show
how close the connection is between one literature
and another, especially in European literatures.

CHAPTER XXXI
<br><br>
LETTERS AND LETTER WRITERS:
PEPYS AND OTHER DIARISTS
</h3>

<p>
Cowper, the poet, who wrote <i>John Gilpin</i>,
is a delightful letter writer.  He had a
number of pets living with him, and these
little friends of his, goldfinches, pigeons, a cat
and a kitten, often make their appearance in
Cowper's letters to his correspondents.  Part of one
of his letters contains a description of the kitten.
</p>

<p>
"I have a kitten, the drollest of all creatures
that ever wore a cat's skin.  Her gambols are
not to be described, and would be incredible, if
they could.  In point of size she is likely to be a
kitten always, being extremely small of her age,
but time, I suppose, that spoils everything, will
make her also a cat.  You will see her, I hope,
before that melancholy period shall arrive, for no
wisdom that she may gain by experience and
reflection hereafter will compensate the loss of her
present hilarity.  She is dressed in a tortoise-shell
suit, and I know that you will delight in
her."
</p>

<p>
Sometimes Cowper used to write his letters in
rhyme.  The paragraph that follows will make
anyone who reads it feel like dancing:
</p>

<p>
"I have heard before of a room with a floor
laid upon springs, and such like things, with so
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P216"></a>216}</span>
much art in every part, that when you went in
you were forced to begin a minuet pace, with an
air and a grace, swimming about, now in and now
out, with a deal of state, in a figure of eight,
without pipe, or string, or anything such thing; and
now I have writ, in a rhyming fit, what will make
you dance, and as you advance, will keep you still,
though against your will, dancing away, alert and
gay, till you come to an end of what I have penn'd,
which that you may do, ere Madam and you are
quite worn out with jigging about I take my leave,
and here you receive a bow profound, down to
the ground, from your humble me&mdash;W.C."
</p>

<p>
It is surprising to learn how many books contain
interesting letters, letters which are gay,
amusing, witty, touching, affectionate, wise, and
very skilfully written.  Some of the most famous
letter writers you will know already from their
books.  Others are famous wholly on account of
their letters.  One of the latter is Madam de
Sévigné, a charming, gifted Frenchwoman who lived
in France as long ago as the seventeenth century.
When her daughter married and left home, Madame
de Sévigné, who was a devoted mother, used
to write gay, fascinating letters to the child she
loved.  She told of the happenings at court, or
intrigues and politics, and of everyday, domestic
affairs.  In this way, it has come about that
although in her lifetime Madame de Sévigné's letters
were comparatively little known, all the years
since then her reputation for wit, wisdom and
charm has been growing, until to-day the
Marquise de Sévigné is regarded as one of the most
brilliant and perfect letter writers, possibly the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P217"></a>217}</span>
most skilful and delightful letter writer that the
world knows.
</p>

<p>
The following is part of one of her letters,
translated from the French, which tells of the
despair of a cook who could not get sufficient of
what he considered proper food to serve to the
King and his following, who were the guests of
his master.
</p>

<p>
"I meant to tell you that the King arrived at
Chantilly last evening.  He hunted the stag by
moonlight, the lanterns were very brilliant; and
altogether the evening, the supper, the play,&mdash;all
went off marvellously well.....
</p>

<p>
"The King arrived on Thursday evening, the
promenade, the collation,&mdash;served on a lawn
carpeted with jonquils&mdash;all was perfect.  At
supper there were a few tables where the roast was
wanting, on account of some guests whose arrival
had not been expected.  This mortified Vatel,
who said several times, 'My honour is gone: I
can never survive this shame.'  He also said to
Gourville, 'My head swims.  I have not slept for
twelve nights.  Help me give the orders.'  Gourville
encouraged him as well as he could....
Gourville told M. le Prince, who went immediately to
Vatel's room, and said to him, 'Vatel, everything
is going on well.  Nothing could be finer than the
King's supper.'  He replied, 'My lord, your
goodness overwhelms me.  I know that the roast
was missing at two tables.'  'Not at all,' said
M. le Prince.  'Don't disturb yourself: everything is
going on well.'  Midnight came; the fireworks,
which cost sixteen thousand francs, did not
succeed, on account of the fog.  At four o'clock in
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P218"></a>218}</span>
the morning, Vatel, going through the chateau,
found every one asleep.  He met a young steward,
who had brought only two hampers of fish:
he asked, 'Is that all?'&mdash;'Yes, Sir.'  The lad did
not know that Vatel had sent to all the seaports.
Vatel waited some time; the other purveyors did
not arrive: his brain reeled; he believed no more
fish could be had: and finding Gourville, he said,
'My dear sir, I shall never survive this disgrace....'"
</p>

<p>
The names of a number of English letter writers,
whose letters most people find delightful,
are: Jonathan Swift, Lady Mary Wortley-Montagu,
Thomas Gray, Horace Walpole, Sir Walter
Scott, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Charles Lamb,
John Keats, Jane Welsh Carlyle, Edward
Fitzgerald, Frances Anne Kemble, William
Makepeace Thackeray, Charles Dickens, the
Brownings, and Robert Louis Stevenson.
</p>

<p>
We feel about journals and diaries in much the
same way as we do about letters.  Such writings
admit us to the intimate companionship of those
whose words we read.  Journals and diaries,
indeed, are more intimate than letters.  There are
a number of remarkable English diarists:&mdash;John
Evelyn, Fanny Burney, Charles Greville,
Benjamin Haydon, Lord Shaftesbury and Thomas
Moore, but the most famous of all is Samuel
Pepys.  Pepys was an official at the Admiralty.
He was born in 1632 and died in 1703.  During
his lifetime, he was a much respected man, a good
official, interested to a certain extent in art, music
and writing.  But he scarcely would be remembered
to-day if he had not kept a diary in which
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P219"></a>219}</span>
he wrote every day for a number of years.  He
wrote his diary in shorthand, a kind of cipher,
and what he wrote filled six volumes.  These
books are now kept in Magdalene College,
Oxford, in the Pepysian Library.  They lay
unnoticed at Magdalene for more than a hundred
years.  Then part of the diary was deciphered,
written out in longhand, and published in 1825.
The complete edition of Pepys, by H. B  Wheatley,
was not published until 1899.  And so the
world has come to know Samuel Pepys from his
diaries as well as it is possible to know anyone.
</p>

<p>
When Pepys sat down to write in his diary at
night he told all the little things he did, what he
thought and how he felt.  It does not seem likely
that he expected what he had written ever to be
read by anyone, but wrote only for the pleasure
of going over the day's events.  We come so
close to Samuel Pepys when we read his diary
that he seems almost to be living in the pages
that we touch with our fingers.
</p>

<p>
Pepys was fond of fine foods and wine, and
enjoyed giving dinners and entertaining.  But
sometimes the entry in the diary contains no more
than an account of an expedition like the following:
... "took coach, it being about seven at night,
and passed and saw the people walking with their
wives and children to take the ayre, and we set
out for home, the sun by and by going down, and
we in the cool of the evening all the way with
much pleasure home, talking and pleasing ourselves
with the pleasure of this day's work....  Anon
it grew dark, and as it grew dark we had the
pleasure to see several glow-worms which was
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P220"></a>220}</span>
mighty pretty."  This was on the way home from
Epsom Downs, Sunday, July 14, 1667.
</p>

<p>
One of the most lovable diaries is Sir Walter
Scott's <i>Journal</i>.  He wrote it, like Pepys, for his
own pleasure.  In the Journal we may enjoy the
companionship of Sir Walter, who is so simple,
unaffected and good that old and young will find
themselves all equally welcome.
</p>

<p>
There is one book that should be kept nearby
for reference, so that we may use it when we need
help with words.  This book, as you have guessed,
is a dictionary.  The use of a dictionary which
you will think of first, is for correct spelling.  To
find out how to spell a word correctly is a good use
to which to put a dictionary.  But it is by no
means the only help that a dictionary can give
us.  Perhaps you are fond of words, which may
be beautiful, amusing, curious, interesting,
startling, exquisitely appropriate, and by means of
which we are able to express the finest shades of
meaning.  If you do care for words, then in a
little spare time, let us turn to a dictionary; any
page of a dictionary will do.  Read what is
printed on the page concerning four or five
English words.
</p>

<p>
Notice carefully the different meanings for the
same word.  Above all, read with attention the
quotations which illustrate how these words may
be used.  Standard and classic writers are the
most helpful teachers when we wish to learn how
to use words.  The English tongue is a noble
language; it is one of our greatest possessions.  To
use it correctly, skilfully, and with grace, is
something that we can learn.  Other books which will
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P221"></a>221}</span>
help us, besides a well-chosen dictionary of the
English language, are dictionaries of synonyms,
and such a book as Mr. H. W. Fowler's <i>Dictionary
of Modern English Usage</i>, a recent publication
by a scholar whose work is not only learned,
but delightfully interesting and helpful because
of its keen wit and enthusiasm.

CHAPTER XXXII
<br><br>
POETRY AND BEAUTY
</h3>

<p>
Let us gather in this chapter a few of the
most beautiful lines in poetry.
</p>

<p>
The youngest of the great English poets
is John Keats.  When he was little more than a
boy, early in the nineteenth century, he wrote
poetry.  One of his poems is called "Ode to a
Nightingale".  Keats had been listening to the voice of
the bird, which sings at night a song considered
more beautiful than that of any other bird, and
he began to imagine how often the nightingale
had sung to people who lived long ago, and how
often in far away, beautiful lands.  As he
thought, he could see these other lands, where
people lived in faery palaces, with open windows
looking on the sea.  Keats' words, which we can
read to-day, keep the song of the bird, and the
picture of the countries where it sang, in perfect
beauty.
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Thou wast not born for death, immortal Bird!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No hungry generations tread thee down;<br>
  The voice I hear this passing night was heard<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In ancient days by emperor and clown:<br>
  Perhaps the self-same song that found a path<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the sad heart of Ruth, when, sick for home,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She stood in tears amid the alien corn;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same that oft-times hath<br>
  Charm'd magic casements, opening on the foam<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of perilous seas, in faery lands forlorn.<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P226"></a>226}</span>
</p>

<p>
Wordsworth, whose poetry at times may seem
dull and uninspired, again and again has the
power to write lines which have a beauty that is
inexplicable.
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rainbow comes and goes,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And lovely is the rose;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moon doth with delight<br>
  Look round her when the heavens are bare;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. . . . .<br>
  Our birth is but a sleep and a forgetting:<br>
  The Soul that rises with us, our life's Star,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hath had elsewhere its setting,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And cometh from afar;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. . . . .<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, in a season of calm weather<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though inland far we be,<br>
  Our souls have sight of that immortal sea<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which brought us hither,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can in a moment travel thither,<br>
  And see the children sport upon the shore,<br>
  And hear the mighty waters rolling evermore.<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
These lines are taken from Wordsworth's "Ode
on Intimations of Immortality".  In another poem
he describes a great mountain, Mont Blanc, which
is snow-capped, so high that the sun when it rises
shines on the mountain's summit long before the
sun's rays reach the country below.  One line of
seven words tells us how at night the mountain
peak seems to be in the company of the moving
stars:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Visited all night by troops of stars."
</p>

<p>
Shakespeare has many of these magic lines, but
one which seems to have come from nowhere, and
for which Shakespeare offers no explanation is:
</p>

<p>
"Child Rowland to the dark tower came."
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P227"></a>227}</span>
</p>

<p>
We ask ourselves who Child Rowland was, and
where was the dark tower.  Then, perhaps, we
begin to weave a story about Child Rowland and
the tower, for poetry often stirs in us something
which makes us think and feel more intensely,
and awakens in us the desire to create beauty
ourselves.
</p>

<p>
It was Thomas Nash, a poet living at the same
time as Shakespeare, who wrote in his poem "In
Time of Pestilence", lines which many other
poets agree are among the most enthralling and
beautiful ever written,&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Brightness falls from the air;<br>
  Queens have died young and fair;<br>
  Dust hath closed Helen's eye;<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
George Meredith, the novelist, who also was a
poet, in his "Love in the Valley" has magical
lines.
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Lovely are the curves of the white owl sweeping<br>
  Wavy in the dusk lit by one large star.<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Robert Louis Stevenson told the Irish poet,
Mr. Yeats, that when he first read "Love in the
Valley" he went about the country where he was
shouting the lines for joy in them.
</p>

<p>
And so we finally understand that this power
of creating strange beauty which stirs and thrills
us all may come to any poet, sometimes to great
poets, sometimes to poets not so great.  Shakespeare
and Nash had it, Keats and Wordsworth,
Meredith who belongs almost to our own times,
and a young poet of a later time even than
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P228"></a>228}</span>
Meredith, James Elroy Flecker, in whose play
<i>Hassan</i>, are many beautiful songs.  The last
song is "The Golden Road to Samarkand".
</p>

<p class="poem">
  We are the Pilgrims, master; we shall go<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Always a little further: it may be<br>
  Beyond that last blue mountain barred with snow<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Across that angry or that glimmering sea,<br>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  White on a throne or guarded in a cave<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There lives a prophet who can understand<br>
  Why men are born: but surely we are brave,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who take the Golden Road to Samarkand.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. . . . . . . .<br>
  We take the Golden Road to Samarkand.<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Coleridge, the Samuel Taylor Coleridge who
was Charles Lamb's friend, wrote a story, a ballad,
following the fashion of the old ballads, which
he called "The Ancient Mariner".  You probably
know this poem already.  But if you do not, find
time to read it; or, possibly, someone may read
parts of it to you.  "The Ancient Mariner" is a
story of the sea, of wanderings, of shipwreck, of
strange sights, of learning that we must love
every thing, not only men and women, but birds
and beasts, and then of the glad returning to the
place which was the sailor's home:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  And now there came both mist and snow,<br>
  And it grew wondrous cold:<br>
  And ice, mast-high, came floating by,<br>
  As green as emerald.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. . . . . . . .<br>
  The Sun's rim dips; the stars rush out:<br>
  At one stride comes the dark;<br>
  With far-heard whisper, o'er the sea,<br>
  Off shot the spectre-bark.<br>
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P229"></a>229}</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  The moving Moon went up the sky,<br>
  And nowhere did abide;<br>
  Softly she was going up,<br>
  And a star or two beside&mdash;<br>
  . . . . . . . .<br>
  O dream of joy! is this indeed<br>
  The lighthouse top I see?<br>
  Is this the hill? is this the kirk?<br>
  Is this mine own countree?<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
No matter how familiar such lines may become,
we should never forget to realize their beauty.
</p>

<p>
Ben Jonson, who lived in the seventeenth
century, wrote, with other poems, a lyric, wise as
well as beautiful, in which we may find life-long
companionship.
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not growing like a tree<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In bulk, doth make man better be;<br>
  Or standing long an oak, three hundred year,<br>
  To fall a log at last, dry, bald, and sere:<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lily of a day<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is fairer far in May,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it fall and die that night;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was the plant and flower of light.<br>
  In small proportions we just beauties see;<br>
  And in short measures, life may perfect be.<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
No one can change these lines and express the
same idea as perfectly as Jonson has given it to
us.  For great poetry has some magic power by
which it conveys to us truth and beauty which
we are not able to discover for ourselves.

CHAPTER XXXIII
<br><br>
POETRY AND TIME
</h3>

<p>
It is good to know the names of the great
English poets and the order of time in which
they come; we may write out such a list for
ourselves if we hope to enjoy poetry.  Many of
you will find no difficulty in learning by heart the
names of the poets, or in remembering the
centuries to which they belong.  The question mark
after the first date in the case of Chaucer and
Spenser means that there is no exact record of
the year in which either of these poets was born.
</p>

<pre>
  Chaucer        1340 ? &mdash; 1400
  Spenser,       1552 ? &mdash; 1599
  Shakespeare,   1564   &mdash; 1616
  Milton,        1608   &mdash; 1674
  Dryden,        1631   &mdash; 1700
  Pope,          1688   &mdash; 1744
  Wordsworth,    1770   &mdash; 1850
  Coleridge,     1772   &mdash; 1834
  Byron,         1788   &mdash; 1824
  Shelley,       1792   &mdash; 1822
  Keats,         1795   &mdash; 1821
  Tennyson,      1809   &mdash; 1892
  Browning,      1812   &mdash; 1889
</pre>

<p><br></p>

<p>
We do not enjoy the work of all these poets
equally; in any case, boys and girls, men and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P231"></a>231}</span>
women, have individual preferences.  Some
people find greater enjoyment in the work of Byron
than in the work, let us suppose, of Tennyson.
Others greatly prefer Tennyson to Browning;
and again these may not care for Byron.  But
many people find delight in reading Browning's
poetry.  Still, we should remember that all these
writers are great poets, and that each has had
power over his own generation and other
generations as well.
</p>

<p>
Chaucer, as you know, is difficult to read
because he lived so many hundreds of years ago,
and the English language has changed considerably
since the time when he wrote poetry.  The
same may be said of Spenser, although in a less
degree.  Dryden and Pope helped to perfect the
style of English poetry, and this, possibly, is their
outstanding claim to greatness.
</p>

<p>
It may help us to know and enjoy poetry if we
choose one or two of the poems written by these
great poets.
</p>

<p>
You may have found the work of Chaucer
already, but it is the Prologue to the <i>Canterbury
Tales</i> which most people, who read Chaucer at
all, know best.  A little study will help us to
read some of Chaucer's lines.  We know also of
Spenser's <i>Faery Queen</i>, of Una and the Red
Cross Knight.  Shakespeare lives as the master
of English literature.  We have some knowledge
of his plays, but we have not yet spoken of his
sonnets.
</p>

<p>
A sonnet is a poem of fourteen lines, usually
divided into an octave&mdash;eight lines&mdash;and a
sestet&mdash;six lines.  There are three varieties of the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P232"></a>232}</span>
sonnet form in English poetry.  That used by
Shakespeare has three four-line stanzas, the first
line in each stanza rhyming with the third, and the
second line with the fourth; these stanzas are
followed by a rhyming couplet.  Those of you who
are specially interested in verse forms will find
under the heading "technical terms", an
interesting note on the sonnet in Mr. H. W. Fowler's
<i>Dictionary of Modern English Usage</i>.  Some of
the most beautiful short poems in the world have
taken the form of the sonnet.  Read Shakespeare's
sonnet beginning with the lines,&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  That time of year thou may'st in me behold<br>
  When yellow leaves, or none, or few, do hang<br>
  Upon those boughs which shake against the cold,<br>
  Bare ruin'd choirs where late the sweet birds sang.<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
See with what beauty Shakespeare clothes the
bare branches of winter trees.  Many times in our
lives, we will think with joy of Shakespeare's
words when we look at the leafless boughs of
trees and remember how the birds in summer
sang in the leafy bowers like choristers in a choir.
Shakespeare used nine words only to give us this
joy.
</p>

<p>
Milton, who was a great poet, also wrote
sonnets.  The best known of his sonnets was
written on his own blindness.  It begins with the line,
</p>

<p class="poem">
  When I consider how my light is spent.<br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
But the most loved poem by Milton is the "Hymn
on the Morning of Christ's Nativity".  The
beginning of the first stanza is as follows:
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P233"></a>233}</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  It was the Winter wilde,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the Heav'n-born-childe<br>
  All meanly wrapt in the rude manger lies;<br>
  Nature in aw to him,<br>
  Had doff't her gawdy trim,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With her great Master so to sympathize:<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Of Dryden, read part of "Alexander's Feast";
and from Pope's work choose the gay, amusing
poem called "The Rape of the Lock".  Wordsworth's
sonnets are specially beautiful; we should
read "Upon Westminster Bridge", and one other
called "The World".  His longer poem, "Ode on
Intimations of Immortality from Recollections of
Early Childhood", will express for you how
beautiful the world is in your eyes, perhaps more
perfectly than the work of any other of the great
poets.
</p>

<p>
Coleridge's poem, "Do You Ask What the Birds
Say?" we should read; Byron's "She Walks in
Beauty"; Shelley's "Ode to the West Wind", or
his poem "To a Skylark"; Keats' "Eve of
St. Agnes"; Tennyson's "Morte d'Arthur"; and
Browning's "Saul".
</p>

<p>
Listen to the music of the first lines belonging
to the poems named in the last paragraph, if you
still are not quite certain that there is delight in
reading poetry.
</p>

<p>
Coleridge's poem begins:&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Do you ask what the birds say?  The Sparrow, the Dove,<br>
  The Linnet, and Thrush, say "I love and I love!"<br>
  In the winter they're silent&mdash;the wind is so strong;<br>
  What it says, I don't know, but it sings a loud song.<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P234"></a>234}</span>
</p>

<p>
The first four lines of Bryon's poem, "She
Walks in Beauty," are:&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  She walks in beauty, like the night<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of cloudless climes and starry skies;<br>
  And all that's best of dark and bright<br>
  Meet in her aspect and her eyes:&mdash;<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
The first stanza of Shelley's "To a Skylark"
is:&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hail to thee, blithe spirit!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bird thou never wert&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That from heaven or near it<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pourest thy full heart<br>
  In profuse strains of unpremeditated art.<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Even this one verse by Shelley gives us the
feeling of rising high towards heaven with the bird
and hearing his song.
</p>

<p>
The beginning of Keats' poem, "The Eve of
St. Agnes", is one of the most beautiful and alluring
openings in all poetry:&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  St. Agnes' Eve&mdash;Ah, bitter chill it was!<br>
  The owl, for all his feathers, was a-cold;&mdash;<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Tennyson's "Morte d'Arthur" is a story of
Arthur and the Round Table, and the great sword
Excalibur.  Its opening lines read:&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  So all day long the noise of battle roll'd<br>
  Among the mountains by the winter sea;&mdash;<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Browning's poems, "How They Brought the
Good News from Ghent to Aix", "The Pied Piper
of Hamelin", and "Hervé Riel", you are likely to
know already.  "Saul" is a more difficult poem, but
in it Browning shows his great power as a poet.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P235"></a>235}</span>
His love poetry, in such poems as "The Last Ride
Together", and "One Word More", is considered
Browning's finest work.  "Saul" is a story taken
from the Bible.  David plays on his harp to Saul,
who is ill.  He tries to find help for Saul in his
despondency.  David finally tells Saul that God
must be a man as well as God, so that He may help
us all.
</p>

<p class="poem">
  He who did most, shall bear most; the strongest shall<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stand the most weak.<br>
  'Tis the weakness in strength, that I cry for! my flesh<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that I seek<br>
  In the Godhead!  I seek and I find it.  O Saul, it shall be<br>
  A Face like my face that receives thee; a man like to me,<br>
  Thou shalt love and be loved by, forever: a Hand like<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this hand<br>
  Shall throw open the gates of new life to thee!  See the<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Christ stand!<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Do you remember how we discovered earlier in
this book that time decides what is great in
writing?  This is true of the work of poets.  We can
see for ourselves how widely great poets differ
in their work.  Some write sweet, simple, clear
and lovely songs; others write poetry which is
difficult to read and understand.  The simple, clear
and lovely songs may last longer than the difficult
poems.  But if the difficult poetry contains great
meaning, it may last too.  A poet sometimes is
great for the people of his own generation, but
the ages that follow may not care for his work.
Yet it may be that after a hundred years or so,
people will love the poet's work again.
</p>

<p>
Is great poetry being written now!  It is difficult
for anyone to answer this question with
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P236"></a>236}</span>
certainty.  Some very lovely poetry has been
written in this twentieth century, in the same way
that beautiful verse has been written in the
English language for hundreds of years.
</p>

<p>
Examples of this beautiful verse from Chaucer's
time to the end of the nineteenth century,
we may find in such books as Palgrave's <i>Golden
Treasury of English Verse</i>; and <i>The Oxford Book
of English Verse</i>, 1250-1900, edited by
Mr. Quiller-Couch.  Several anthologies, called <i>Books of
Georgian Poetry</i>, and others beside, contain
poetry written in the twentieth century.
</p>

<p>
There are many poets of whose work we have
not spoken.  Some of their names you know
already; some you will learn by and by.  These
poets may have lived long ago, or no longer ago
than last century, or they may be living to-day.
Three outstanding names belonging to the
Victorian Age are those of Matthew Arnold, Dante
Gabriel Rossetti, and Charles Algernon
Swinburne.  We should remember the names also of a
group of women who have written poetry: Mrs. Browning,
Christina Rossetti, Emily Brontë, and
Emily Dickinson, who is an American poet.
</p>

<p>
Some modern poets are: Rudyard Kipling,
Robert Bridges, W. B. Yeats, Rupert Brooke,
James Elroy Flecker, Laurence Binyon, William
Watson, George Russell, W. H. Davies, Walter de
la Mare, Alice Meynell, Katherine Tynan,
W. W. Gibson, John Masefield, James Stephens,
Lascelles Abercrombie, Siegfried Sassoon, Ralph
Hodgson, Edmund Blunden, and a sister and two
brothers, three poets in one family, Edith, Osbert
and Sacheverell Sitwell.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P237"></a>237}</span>
</p>

<p>
For an ending we may quote a verse from a
poem written by a modern poet, Mr. Walter de la
Mare.  The name of the poem is "The Listeners":
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'Is there anybody there!' said the Traveller<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knocking on the moonlit door;<br>
  And his horse in the silence champed the grasses<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the forest's ferny floor;<br>
  And a bird flew up out of the turret,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Above the Traveller's head:<br>
  And he smote upon the door a second time;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Is there anybody there?' he said.<br>

CHAPTER XXXIV
<br>
READING FOR YOUR OWN COUNTRY
</h3>

<p>
&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;

<p class="t3">
ENGLISH LITERATURE AND ITS BRANCHES
</p>

<p>
Most of us, no matter where we may
happen to live, are not far away from a
newspaper office.  We may walk down a
village street and stop at the door of a building
where a newspaper is published, or we may drive
in from the farm, and see a printing press
through the open door of the same office.  Perhaps
it is an old-fashioned printing establishment
where type is still set by hand; good printing
often is taken from hand-set type.  Or some of
you may pass, day by day, a newspaper building
in a town or city where the latest machinery is
constantly at work on edition after edition of a
daily newspaper.
</p>

<p>
We know without being told that newspapers
form one of the great channels of communication
in the modern world.  To learn how to read a
newspaper in the best way is something we can
do for our own good, for the place in which
we live, for the country round about, our own
country and nation, and so on in ever-widening
circles.
</p>

<p>
Newspapers possess a special fascination for
almost everyone.  We like to look in through the
windows of a newspaper building and see the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P242"></a>242}</span>
machinery moving rapidly.  It is exciting to watch
the great sheets being folded and coming off the
presses.  Perhaps you know a young man or
woman who is a reporter; possibly some day you
will be a reporter yourself.  It is worth spending
time trying to understand all that a newspaper
means.
</p>

<p>
If we know anything about the way in which
news is gathered, written, and printed, we know
that sometimes news will be inaccurate, because
newspaper work is done with speed.  The work
of a daily newspaper is to provide its readers with
the day's news, and this must be accomplished
quickly, or it will be to-morrow before we know
where we are.  It is the pride of a newspaper to
publish correct news, as far as that is possible.
But when we read a newspaper we must make
allowance for the fact that some of the news is an
estimate of what happened, rather than a statement
of the absolutely true details of what has
happened.  Yet it is astonishing, considering all
the circumstances, how few mistakes there are in
newspapers.
</p>

<p>
We read newspapers to be well informed; to
know how to relate ourselves to the life about us;
and to find out what has happened that particularly
concerns us in many different ways, as, for
instance, in sports and games, schools and
education, business and employment, about our
neighbours and companions, politics and public affairs,
even the hobbies in which we are interested, flower
shows, cattle shows, sales of stamps, puzzles,
jokes, wireless news, discoveries, inventions,
explorations.  By reading a good newspaper in
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P243"></a>243}</span>
the right way we keep in touch with current
history.
</p>

<p>
There are other periodical publications, besides
daily newspapers, weeklies and many monthly
magazines, each of which has its own use and
purpose.  Some of these publications we may need to
read, according to what our interests are.  These
you can choose for yourselves, as you grow older.
</p>

<p>
What is known as literature, writing of permanent
value and beauty, not technical or scientific,
but of general interest, as a rule finds its way
into books.  The time has come now when we can
consider for a moment how many different
literatures there are in the world.
</p>

<p>
Some writers belonging to literatures of
countries other than our own, by this time you can
name for yourselves.  You know that there was a
great Greek literature, a Latin literature, and
Hebrew literature.  The first name that comes into
your minds belonging to Greek literature is
Homer.  Virgil was one of the great writers of
Latin literature.  The Bible is Hebrew literature.
Dante's work is found in Italian literature;
Cervantes' in Spanish literature; Goethe's in
German literature; Dumas' work and Victor
Hugo's and the work of a number of other writers
belong to French literature.  There are famous
Russian novelists.  Hans Andersen was a Dane.
Maeterlinck is a Belgian.  <i>The Arabian Nights</i>, in
origins at least, takes us to countries as far away
as China, India, Persia, and Egypt.  All these
literatures come into our lives and into the lives
of other people, and so we understand how famous
books help to bind the world together.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P244"></a>244}</span>
</p>

<p>
English literature is one of the great literatures
of the world.  If it pleases us to do so, we can
count that it begins in the times of the
Anglo-Saxons.  Even if we take Chaucer as the first
great name in English literature, this means that
for six hundred years, famous, glorious books in
poetry, story, drama, history, and other styles of
composition, have been produced at intervals, but
in an unbroken succession, in the literature which
we can call our own.
</p>

<p>
English literature, as you know, includes the
work of English, Scottish and Irish writers.  If
we think of English literature as a tree, one of its
branches, which comes from the same root, is
American literature.  Other branches of this tree
are the literatures of Canada, Australia, South
Africa, and the work of writers in India who
publish their books in the English language, known
as Anglo-Indian literature.  As you know, all these
literatures, with the exception of American literature,
belong to the nations of the British Empire.
Kipling was thinking of the nations of the Empire
when he called one of his books <i>The Five Nations</i>.
</p>

<p>
Some day you may find out for yourselves how
many names you can remember of writers belonging
to English literature, then any you know
belonging to the branch literatures of Canada,
Australia, South Africa and Anglo-India, and to
American literature.
</p>

<p>
There are few lists in the world as splendid as
the long roll of great writers in English literature.
It is worth while learning the most famous
names by heart.  Numbers of these writers you
know already.  Many people find the greatest
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P245"></a>245}</span>
enjoyment they have from books in English literature.
</p>

<p>
The names of some of the most distinguished
American writers are Emerson, Thoreau, Mark
Twain, Hawthorne, Herman Melville, Walt
Whitman, Edgar Allan Poe, Fenimore Cooper,
Longfellow, Parkman, Motley, and Washington Irving;
many critics would add the name of Emily
Dickinson.  There are a number of interesting books
in which you can read of American literature.  A
librarian will help you to choose one of them.
</p>

<p>
Names belonging to Australian and New Zealand
literature are Henry Kingsley, Adam Lindsay
Gordon, Kendall, Domett, Rolf Boldrewood,
Lawson, Stephens, Louis Becke, Browne, Collins,
Farjeon, Ada Cambridge, and Mrs. Campbell
Praed.  Katherine Mansfield was born in New
Zealand and the lady sometimes known as
"Elizabeth", Countess Russell, in Australia.  You
may find in a library articles on the writers of
Australia and New Zealand.  Someone might read
aloud to you from an anthology of Australian
verse.
</p>

<p>
South Africa has not had long to establish a
literature.  One well-known South African name
is that of Olive Schreiner.  Others are Pringle,
Bell, Mrs. Millin, and a young poet, Roy
Campbell.  A collection of English South African
poetry is called <i>The Treasury of South African
Poetry and Verse</i>.
</p>

<p>
Many Canadians have written poetry and verse
in which are true descriptions of nature and the
spirit of nature in Canada.  Some Canadian poets'
names you will have learned already: Roberts,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P246"></a>246}</span>
Carman, Lampman, Campbell, Scott, Isabella
Valancy Crawford, Marjorie Pickthall,
W. H. Drummond, whose habitant poems abound in
humour and the delineation of character, two
poets who served in the War, John McCrae and
Bernard Trotter, Wilson MacDonald, and
E. J. Pratt, a native of Newfoundland, the oldest
dominion in the Empire.  Other names you will
find mentioned in several good anthologies.
Haliburton was a humorist.  The most widely read
Canadian humorist of the present day is
Mr. Stephen Leacock.  Joseph Howe was a writer, an
orator and statesman.  The Golden Dog, by
William Kirby, is a famous Canadian novel.  Other
novel writers are Miss Lily Dougall, Mrs. Cotes,
Miss Mazo de la Roche, Sir Gilbert Parker,
"Ralph Connor", Norman Duncan, Miss
L. M. Montgomery.  A number of writers of Canadian
fiction are doing work to-day which may become
eminent.  There are writers in French Canada,
both of prose and poetry.  Canadian historians,
English and French, have accomplished good
work.  The two series, <i>Makers of Canada</i> and
<i>Chronicles of Canada</i>, contain histories which are
well worth reading.
</p>

<p>
Here is a list of readings from Canadian
literature, chapters from a few novels, poems from
books of poetry, short stories, two fairy tales,
two speeches by Canadian statesmen, a short
history.  These may guide you to books which you
may enjoy.  In addition, we should read William
Kirby's novel, <i>The Golden Dog</i>.  It is interesting
to remember that Miss Pauline Johnson, whose
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P247"></a>247}</span>
poetical gift was undoubted, was a Canadian
Mohawk Indian.

<h3>
AFTERWORD
</h3>

<p>
The name of this chapter, Afterword, seems
as if it were an ending.  But some endings
in reality are beginnings.  We all know the
look of a catalogue of seeds, with its brilliantly
coloured flowers.  This book, which belongs to
you, in one sense is like a seedsman's catalogue.
The true delight of gardening is in choosing the
seeds, digging, fertilizing and smoothing the
garden till it is ready for sowing and planting.  Then
we look forward to the first green leaves, flowers,
and fruits.  There is an infinite deal to learn
about gardens, and the seedsman's catalogue is
only the beginning.  This book is the beginning
of the voyage of discovery in the world of your
own books.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Because we have spoken in the preceding chapters
almost wholly of writers and books, we should
take care not to place too much emphasis on
writing as an occupation.  The world owes much to
the writers of great books,&mdash;happiness, inspiration,
enjoyment, wisdom which we may take from
them if we will, learning, and at all times,
unending entertainment.
</p>

<p>
But how many other people there are in the
world to whom we owe love and gratitude:
soldiers, sailors, explorers, inventors, statesmen,
law-givers, physicians, discoverers, scientists,
preachers, teachers, evangelists, missionaries,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P250"></a>250}</span>
fathers, mothers, all the men and women who
make our streets, build our houses, bake our
bread, bring us food, make our clothes, sell us
what we need, look after the finances of the world,
manage our railways and run the trains, fly in
airships, and of great importance in their
occupation, men and women who grow food as farmers.
Still, we dearly love good books and great
writers.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
No one should read all the time, for people are
more important than books.  Yet it would be a
pity for any boy or girl not to read at all.  Francis
Bacon, the essayist, of whom we learned a very
little in the chapter on essays and essayists, says
in one of his writings: "Reading maketh a full
man, conference a ready man, and writing an
exact man."
</p>

<p>
Bacon means by the first part of this saying
that a man who does not read at all is sometimes
empty-minded, while a man who reads well has
many thoughts in his mind, good, sweet and
profitable.  If Bacon were in the world to-day, and
noticed, as he would be certain to notice, for
Bacon was a most observant man, how much time
some people spend in reading, he might have
added a sentence saying that continual reading
may keep people from thinking.  Rightly used,
books are an aid in teaching us how to think.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
There are many books which have not been
mentioned in these pages, some of them famous,
many of them delightful, important or amusing.
Some of these books you will find for yourselves
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P251"></a>251}</span>
as time goes on; some you may know already.
Perhaps you may have wondered why nothing has
been said of this or that book.  But it is true that
there is always an individual choice in books, as in
other things.  You will find&mdash;and love&mdash;your own
books, the books which belong to you.  To discover
one's own books for one's self is a great
adventure.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Some of you may be specially interested in
French literature; and, presently, you will read
the works of the great French dramatist Molière,
one of whose characters is the famous Monsieur
Jourdain, who had spoken prose all his life
without knowing it.  Balzac and Flaubert are two
other names among a multitude of French writers.
The literatures of other countries offer us
reading which many people enjoy greatly.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Numbers of fine books are continually being
produced by writers in English.  English novels
especially make good reading.  Among writers of
a comparatively recent date who have not been
mentioned are John Ruskin, Walter Pater, Henry
James, an American, Anthony Trollope, William
Morris, George Du Maurier, William de Morgan,
and many others.  Certainly, if you can find time,
read the witty, entertaining Irish stories of two
ladies, E. OE. Somerville and Martin Ross,
especially their first book, <i>Some Experiences of an
Irish R. M.</i>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Then there are modern writers, writers of
your own day.  Remember that a library is an
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P252"></a>252}</span>
excellent place in which to obtain advice and help
in reading, especially in choosing modern books.
There are many modern novelists, critics, and
dramatists, as well as poets, whose work is well
known.  Some names are: Bernard Shaw, H. G. Wells,
Arnold Bennett, Quiller-Couch, Max Beerbohm,
John Galsworthy, Anthony Hope, W. W. Jacobs,
Booth Tarkington, Willa Cather, Norman
Douglas, H. M. Tomlinson, Clemence Dane,
Virginia Woolf, George Moore, Hugh Walpole, May
Sinclair, Mary Webb, E. M. Delafield,, James
Stephens, Henry Williamson and J. C. Squire, as
well as others whose names you will add to the
list when you read their books.  Such writers as
Katherine Mansfield and W. H. Hudson have left
work which belongs to the present day, and may
last for generations.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Great books are sometimes difficult to read, but
when we conquer a great book we have discovered
a new country, and enjoy the reward of the
discoverer.  It is a matter of choice whether we learn
how to read great books that are difficult; but to
read well is always a good choice.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
We should never forget, however, that one of
the principles of good reading is to read books in
which we find pleasure.  We will grow most
successfully in this way along the lines of our own
natural tastes and inclinations.  So if we prefer
history, let us read history; and biography, if this
reading gives us most pleasure.  In the same way,
following each his or her own special preference,
we may choose mechanics, invention, exploration,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P253"></a>253}</span>
travel, science, architecture, art, music, poetry,
essays, criticism, or books which will help us in
the study of human nature.  Books on the betterment
of the world and on social conditions, books
about homes and home life, are important.
</p>

<p>
Some people obtain most benefit from reading
a very few books carefully, while others read
many books.  There are people, often of great
value to the world, who are not as much interested
in books as they are in action.  They prefer
travelling to reading of travels; and would choose to
build a bridge, or climb a mountain, rather than
read history or poetry.  The French have a
proverb which says, <i>Chacun à son gôut</i>, which means
each to his own taste; and this is true in books as
it is in other things.
</p>

<p>
Do you remember the list of books in Chapter
twenty-eight, on Reading for What You Want To
Be, many of them biographies?  Some day, when
you have an opportunity, ask permission to look
over the books in the working library of some man
or woman who is following the occupation with
attracts you most.  We can learn a great deal from
the attentive study of such a library.  Presently,
you may begin to collect your own library.  The
best way to do this is slowly, with taste,
discrimination and care.  There is great enjoyment in
buying, one by one, the books you care for most;
and so, almost before you know what is happening,
you will have a library of your own.  Which
book would you choose first to buy for your own
library?  Sometimes, in looking through the
library of a friend, we may find the very first book
bought by the owner of the library when he was a
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P254"></a>254}</span>
boy, or when the owner was a girl, as the case
may be.
</p>

<p>
One of the pleasures of reading is to read
according to times and seasons: To read books of
out-of-doors on winter evenings, as well as books
of adventure; to read poetry in summer, when we
can spend much time under the sky.  But those
who love poetry, read it all through the year.  We
may read essays and biography when we are
lonely and long for companionship.  Novels are
constantly enjoyable; a good novel tells us much
about human nature.
</p>

<p>
One of the most beautiful seasons for reading
is at Christmas time.  Year by year, we may read
the story of the shepherds in Saint Luke, ballads
of Christmas, <i>A Christmas Carol</i> by Charles
Dickens, and Milton's great "Hymn on the
Morning of Christ's Nativity".  Reading of this
character deepens our happiness.
</p>

<p>
By such means as these we come to recognize
good reading, and can test all books by the great
books we have read.
